Abstract: Objective. We evaluated the association between socioeconomic status and racial/ ethnic differences in endometrial cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment, and survival. Methods. We conducted a population-based study among 3656 women. Results. Multivariate analyses showed that either race/ethnicity or income, but not both, was associated with advanced-stage disease. Age, stage at diagnosis, and income were independent predictors of hysterectomy. African American ethnicity, increased age, aggressive histology, poor tumor grade, and advanced-stage disease were associated with increased risk for death; higher income and hysterectomy were associated with decreased risk for death. Conclusions. Lower income was associated with advanced-stage disease, lower likelihood of receiving a hysterectomy, and lower rates of survival. Earlier diagnosis and removal of barriers to optimal treatment among lower-socioeconomic status women will diminish racial/ethnic differences in endometrial cancer survival.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined racial differences in cardiac catheterization rates and reviewed whether patients' beliefs or other variables were associated with observed disparities. Methods. We did a prospective observational cohort study of 1045 White and African American patients at 5 Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers whose nuclear imaging studies indicated reversible cardiac ischemia. Results. There were few demographic differences between White and African American patients in our sample. African Americans were less likely than Whites to undergo cardiac catheterization. African Americans were more likely than Whites to indicate a strong reliance on religion and to report racial and social class discrimination and were less likely to indicate a generalized trust in people but did not differ from White patients on numerous other attitudes about health and health care. Neither sociodemographic or clinical characteristics nor patients' beliefs explained the observed disparities, but physicians' assessments of the procedure's importance and patients' likelihood of coronary disease seemed to account for differences not otherwise explained. Conclusions. Patients' preferences are not the likely source of racial disparities in the use of cardiac catheterization among veterans using VA care, but physicians' assessments warrant further attention.

Abstract: Latina mothers in the United States enjoy surprisingly favorable birth outcomes despite their social disadvantages. This "Latina paradox" is particularly evident among Mexican-born women. The social and cultural factors that contribute to this paradox are maintained by community networks - informal systems of prenatal care that are composed of family, friends, community members, and lay health workers. This informal system confers protective factors that provide a behavioral context for healthy births. US-born Latinas are losing this protection, although it could be maintained with the support of community-based informal care systems. We recommend steps to harness the benefits of informal systems of prenatal care in Latino communities to meet the increasing needs of pregnant Latina women.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated the association between unemployment and early cause-specific mortality to determine whether the relationship was modified by other risk indicators. Methods. Female and male twins (n=20 632) were followed with regard to mortality from 1973 through 1996. Questionnaire data from 1973 were used to obtain information on experience of unemployment and on social, behavioral, health, and personality characteristics. Results. Unemployment was associated with an increased risk of suicide and death from undetermined causes. Low education, personality characteristics, use of sleeping pills or tranquilizers, and serious or long-lasting illness tended to strengthen the association between unemployment and early mortality. Conclusions. An increased risk of death from external causes implies a need for support for those experiencing unemployment, particularly susceptible individuals.

Abstract: The US health system spends far more on the "technology" of care (e.g., drugs, devices) than on achieving equity in its delivery. For 1991 to 2000, we contrasted the number of lives saved by medical advances with the number of deaths attributable to excess mortality among African Americans. Medical advances averted 176633 deaths, but equalizing the mortality rates of Whites and African Americans would have averted 886202 deaths. Achieving equity may do more for health than perfecting the technology of care.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined whether racial differences exist in cholesterol monitoring, use of lipid-lowering agents, and achievement of guideline-recommended low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Methods. We reviewed charts for 1045 African American and White patients with coronary heart disease at 5 Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. Results. Lipid levels were obtained in 67.0% of patients. Whites and African Americans had similar screening rates and mean lipid levels. Among the 544 ideal candidates for therapy, rates of treatment and achievement of target LDL levels were similar. Conclusions. We found no disparities in cholesterol management. This absence of disparities may be the result of VA quality improvement initiatives or prescription coverage through the VA health care system.

Abstract: Objectives. We assessed the association between life-course socioeconomic status or position (SEP) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 4286 women aged 60 to 79 years. Results. Women experiencing adverse socioeconomic circumstances across the life course were less likely to have used HRT. The associations of childhood socioeconomic measures with HRT use were independent of adult SEP, behavioral risk factors, and physiological risk factors for heart disease. Conclusions. SEP from across the life course is associated with HRT use. Because the association between early life SEP and HRT is not fully explained by adult risk factors, residual confounding (which is not captured by adjustment for adult variables only) may explain some of the disparity between observational studies and randomized controlled trials in this area.

Abstract: Objectives. We performed a historical review of cardiovascular risk profiles of Irish immigrants to the United States, 1850-1970, in regard to lifestyle, socioeconomic circumstances, and social capital. Methods. We analyzed US Census data from 1850-1970, area-based social and epidemiological data from Boston, data from Ireland's National Nutrition Surveillance Centre, and literature on Irish migration. Results. The Irish were consistently at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, a risk that related initially to material deprivation, across the life course of at least 2 generations. Conclusions. The principal difference between the Irish and other disadvantaged immigrant groups, such as the Italians, was dietary habits influenced by experiences during the Irish famine. Although there was a psychosocial component to the disadvantage and discrimination they experienced as an ethnic group, the Irish also exhibited strong community networks and support structures that might have been expected to counteract discrimination's negative effects. However, the Irish's high levels of social capital were not protective for cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Conclusions regarding racial differences in care following a newly elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may differ depending on whether follow-up care outside the VA is considered. Consecutive Philadelphia, Pa, VA patients with newly elevated PSA tests (n = 183) were interviewed 1 year after baseline. Among exclusive VA users, Blacks had higher rates of urology referrals and prostate biopsies compared with Whites. However, these racial differences were attenuated when care obtained outside the VA also was considered.

Abstract: Objectives. We compared cervical cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis, and survival in Medicaid-insured and non-Medicaid-insured populations. Methods. We stratified the sample by age and used ordered logistic regression to predict stage at diagnosis and used Cox proportional hazards regression to predict survival. Results. Medicaid insured nearly one quarter of women diagnosed with cervical cancer. The likelihood of late-stage disease was greatest for women who enrolled in Medicaid after diagnosis. Women younger than 65 years who enrolled in Medicaid after diagnosis were more likely to die from cervical cancer than were women who were not insured by Medicaid (hazard ratio = 2.40, 95% confidence interval = 1.49, 3.86). Conclusions. Our study underscores the importance of cervical cancer screening programs targeted at low-income women.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to provide comparative data on smoking habits in countries of the former Soviet Union. Methods. We conducted cross-sectional surveys in 8 former Soviet countries with representative national samples of the population 18 years or older. Results. Smoking rates varied among men, from 43.3% to 65.3% among the countries examined. Results showed that smoking among women remains uncommon in Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Moldova (rates of 2.4%-6.3%). In Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia, rates were higher (9.3%-15.5%). Men start smoking at significantly younger ages than women, smoke more cigarettes per day, and are more likely to be nicotine dependent. Conclusions. Smoking rates among men in these countries have been high for some time and remain among the highest in the world. Smoking rates among women have increased from previous years and appear to reflect transnational tobacco company activity.

Abstract: Objective. We explored methods and potential applications of a systematic approach to studying and monitoring social disparities in health and health care. Methods. Using delayed or no prenatal care as an example indicator, we (1) categorized women into groups with different levels of underlying social advantage; (2) described and graphically displayed rates of the indicator and relative group size for each social group; (3) identified and measured disparities, calculating relative risks and rate differences to compare each group with its a priori most-advantaged counterpart; (4) examined changes in rates and disparities over time; and (5) conducted multivariate analyses for the overall sample and "atrisk" groups to identify particular factors warranting attention. Results. We identified at-risk groups and relevant factors and suggest ways to direct efforts for reducing prenatal care disparities. Conclusions. This systematic approach should be useful for studying and monitoring disparities in other indicators of health and health care.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the effects of self-reported experiences of racial discrimination on Black-White differences in preterm (less than 37 weeks gestation) and low-birthweight (less than 2500 g) deliveries. Methods. Using logistic regression models, we analyzed data on 352 births among women enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. Results. Among Black women, 50% of those with preterm deliveries and 61% of those with low-birthweight infants reported having experienced racial discrimination in at least 3 situations; among White women, the corresponding percentages were 5% and 0%. The unadjusted odds ratio for preterm delivery among Black versus White women was 2.54 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33, 4.85), but this value decreased to 1.88 (95% CI = 0.85, 4.12) after adjustment for experiences of racial discrimination and to 1.11 (95% CI = 0.51, 2.41) after additional adjustment for alcohol and tobacco use, depression, education, and income. The corresponding odds ratios for low birthweight were 4.24 (95% CI = 1.31, 13.67), 2.11 (95% CI = 0.75, 5.93), and 2.43 (95% CI = 0.79, 7.42). Conclusions. Self-reported experiences of racial discrimination were associated with preterm and low-birthweight deliveries, and such experiences may contribute to Black-White disparities in perinatal outcomes.

Abstract: Objectives. We carried out analyses of smoking in relation to poverty and child care responsibility among women aged 18-54 years residing in the United States. Methods. With data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we assessed the interaction effects of poverty and living with young children on maternal smoking behavior among 61 700 women aged 18-54 years in 4 different racial/ethnic groups. Results. For non-White racial/ethnic groups, the prevalence of smoking among women with small children in the household was lower than that among women without small children. However, White women were more likely to smoke if they were poor and living with small children (odds ratio = 1.14, 95% confidence interval = 1.03, 1.26). Conclusions. These results suggest that child care responsibility confers an increased risk of smoking among low-income White women.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the relationship between parents' experiences of racism and children's well-being and the influence of the residential neighborhood characteristics on this relationship. Methods. African American families were recruited from Baltimore neighborhoods. Parental measures included racism experiences and coping. Neighborhood measures included demographic characteristics, social cohesion, and social climate. Children's mental health was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist. Analysis was performed with multilevel modeling. Results. Parents who denied experiences of racism also reported higher rates of behavior problems among their preschool-aged children. For families living in neighborhoods characterized by fear of victimization, parents who actively coped with racism experiences by confronting the person involved or taking some sort of action in response to racism reported lower rates of anxiety and depression for their preschool-aged children. Conclusions. Experiences of and responses to racism among African American parents have important effects on the well-being of their young children.

Abstract: Little is known about the self-care practices of chronically ill African Americans or how lack of access to health care affects self-care. Results from a qualitative interview study of 167 African Americans who had one or more chronic illnesses found that self-care practices were culturally based, and the insured reported more extensive programs of self-care. Those who had some form of health insurance much more frequently reported the influence of physicians and health education programs in self-care regimens than did those who were uninsured. It is concluded that the cultural components of self-care have been underemphasized, and further, that the potential to maximize chronic illness management through self-care strategies is not realized for those who lack access to health care.

Abstract: Objectives. We determined whether African American women's lifetime exposure to interpersonal racial discrimination is associated with pregnancy outcomes. Methods. We performed a case-control study among 104 African American women who delivered very low birthweight (< 1500 g) preterm (< 37 weeks) infants and 208 African American women who delivered non-low-birthweight (> 2500g) term infants in Chicago, III. Results. The unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio of very low birthweight infants for maternal lifetime exposure to interpersonal racism in 3 or more domains equaled 3.2 (95% confidence intervals = 1.5, 6.6) and 2.6 (1.2, 5.3), respectively. This association tended to persist across maternal sociodemographic, biomedical, and behavioral characteristics. Conclusions. The lifelong accumulated experiences of racial discrimination by African American women constitute an independent risk factor for preterm delivery.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the association between patient race/ethnicity and patient-physician communication during medical visits. Methods. We used audiotape and questionnaire data collected in 1998 and 2002 to determine whether the quality of medical-visit communication differs among African American versus White patients. We analyzed data from 458 African American and White patients who visited 61 physicians in the Baltimore, Md-Washington, DC-Northern Virginia metropolitan area. Outcome measures that assessed the communication process, patient-centeredness, and emotional tone (affect) of the medical visit were derived from audiotapes coded by independent raters. Results. Physicians were 23% more verbally dominant and engaged in 33% less patient-centered communication with African American patients than with White patients. Furthermore, both African American patients and their physicians exhibited lower levels of positive affect than White patients and their physicians did. Conclusions. Patient-physician communication during medical visits differs among African American versus White patients. Interventions that increase physicians' patient-centeredness and awareness of affective cues with African Americans patients and that activate African American patients to participate in their health care are important strategies for addressing racial/ethnic disparities in health care.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to ascertain whether the tobacco industry has conceptualized the US immigrant population as a separate market. Methods. We conducted a content analysis of major tobacco industry documents. Results. The tobacco industry has engaged in 3 distinct marketing strategies aimed at US immigrants: geographically based marketing directed toward immigrant communities, segmentation based on immigrants' assimilation status, and coordinated marketing focusing on US immigrant groups and their countries of origin. Conclusions. Public health researchers should investigate further the tobacco industry's characterization of the assimilated and non-assimilated immigrant markets, and its specific strategies for targeting these groups, in order to develop informed national and international tobacco control countermarketing strategies designed to protect immigrant populations and their countries of origin.

Abstract: A survey of 2125 middle-school students in central California examined adolescents' exposure to tobacco marketing in stores and its association with self-reported smoking. Two thirds of sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade students reported at least weekly visits to small grocery, convenience, or liquor stores. Such visits were associated with a 50% increase in the odds of ever smoking, even after control for social, influences to smoke. Youth smoking rates may benefit from efforts to reduce adolescents' exposure to tobacco marketing in stores.

Abstract: Inorganic arsenic is naturally occurring in groundwaters throughout the United States. This study investigated arsenic exposure and self-report of 9 chronic diseases. We received private well-water samples and questionnaires from 1185 people who reported drinking their water for 20 or more years. Respondents with arsenic levels of 2 μg/L or greater were statistically more likely to report a history of depression, high blood pressure, circulatory problems, and bypass surgery than were respondents with arsenic concentrations less than 2 μg/L.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined racial/ethnic differences in the seroprevalence of selected infectious agents in analyses stratified according to risk categories to identify patterns and to determine whether demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics explain these differences. Methods. We analyzed data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, comparing differences among groups in regard to the prevalence of infection with hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, Toxoplasma gondii, Helicobacter pylori, and herpes simplex virus type 2. Results. Racial/ethnic differences were greater among those in the low-risk category. In the case of most infectious agents, odds associated with race/ethnicity were almost 2 times greater in that category than in the high-risk category. Conclusions. Stratification and adjustment for socioeconomic factors reduced or eliminated racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of infection in the high-risk but not the low-risk group, wherein race/ethnicity remained significant and might have been a surrogate for unmeasured risk factors.

Abstract: Occupational health remains neglected in developing countries because of competing social, economic, and political challenges. Occupational health research in developing countries should recognize the social and political context of work relations, especially the fact that the majority of developing countries lack the political mechanisms to translate scientific findings into effective policies. Researchers in the developing world can achieve tangible progress in promoting occupational health only if they end their professional isolation and examine occupational health in the broader context of social justice and national development in alliance with researchers from other disciplines. An occupational health research paradigm in developing countries should focus less on the workplace and more on the worker in his or her social context.

Abstract: Established in 1999, the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety advises the World Health Organization (WHO) on vaccine-related safety issues and enables WHO to respond promptly, efficiently, and with scientific rigor to issues of vaccine safety with potential global importance. The committee also assesses the implications of vaccine safety for practice worldwide and for WHO policies. We describe the principles on which the committee was established, its modus operandi, and the scope of the work undertaken, both present and future. We highlight its recent recommendations on major issues, including the purported link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism and the safety of the mumps, influenza, yellow fever, BCG, and smallpox vaccines as well as that of thiomersal-containing vaccines.

Abstract: Although the history of childhood lead poisoning started a century ago in the United States, the first French cases were identified in 1985. Instead of merely adapting knowledge accumulated for decades, the public health professionals and activists involved had to reestablish, against incredulity from medical authorities and resistance from policymakers, all the evidence: that children were the main group concerned; that cases were not isolated but part of an epidemic; that wall paint in old, dilapidated apartments was the source of contamination; and that poor housing conditions, and not cultural practices, were responsible for the high incidence in African families. This "reinvention" illustrates more general sociological phenomena: discontinuities in medical history, strength of culturalist prejudices toward immigrants, resistance to socioeconomic interpretations of disease, and struggles between different perspectives in public health. The history shows that public health is the product of intellectual and political struggles to impose visions of the world.

Abstract: Objectives. We hypothesized that chronic stressors associated with an everyday social role (work) would interact with a traumatic macrosocial stressor (the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001) in predicting mental health status (during the fall of 2001). Methods. We used mail surveys returned as part of wave 3 of a workplace cohort study, both before and after September 11, 2001, to assess decision latitude, sexual harassment, generalized workplace abuse, psychological distress, and alcohol use. We also used regression analyses to assess the main effect of September 11 and interactions between September 11 and stressors, after control for baseline mental health. Results. The main effect of September 11 on elevated alcohol use was significant for women but not for men. For women, work stressors significantly interacted with experiencing the events of September 11 to affect alcohol use and anxiety outcomes. Conclusions. Women experiencing chronic work stressors were most vulnerable to elevated psychological distress and alcohol use after September 11, 2001.

Abstract: Objectives. We analyzed state-specific uninsurance trends among US adults aged 18 to 64 years. Methods. We used logistic regression models to examine Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data for uninsurance from 1992 to 2001 in 47 states. Results. Overall, uninsurance rates increased in 35 states and remained unchanged in 12 states. Increases were observed among people aged 30 to 49 years (in 34 states) and 50 to 64 years (in 24 states), and increases were also observed among individuals at middle and low income levels (in 39 states and 19 states, respectively), individuals employed for wages (in 33 states), and the self-employed (in 18 states). Conclusions. Among adults aged 18-64, rates of uninsurance increased in most states from 1992 through 2001. Decreased availability of employer-sponsored health insurance, rising health care costs, and state fiscal crises are likely to worsen the growing uninsurance problem.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined correlates of trading sex for money, drugs, and shelter, or food among drug-using men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods. Audio computer-assisted self-interviewing questionnaires were completed by 387 MSM. The association of predictors with sex trading was assessed with χ2 tests and multiple logistic regression. Results. Sex-trading prevalence was 62.5% (95% confidence interval = 57.7%, 67.4%). Sex trading was associated with crack use, injection drug use, childhood maltreatment, nongay self-identification, and homelessness (adjusted odds ratios = 3.72, 2.28, 2.62, 2.21, and 1.88, respectively). Conclusions. Multiple risk factors are associated with sex trading among MSM. Interventions may need to address crack and injection drug use, homelessness, and childhood maltreatment and target non-gay-identified MSM who engage in sex trading.

Pages: 1908-1916
Abstract: I reviewed ethical and scientific aspects of 6 human pesticide-dosing studies submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for consideration during the pesticide reregistration process. All had serious ethical or scientific deficiencies - or both - including unacceptable informed consent procedures, unmanaged financial conflicts of interest, inadequate statistical power, inappropriate test methods and endpoints, and distorted results. Given today's knowledge of the effects of pesticides, there is no assurance that any such study can be completely free of short-term risks, long-term risks, or both. Therefore, there is no basis for allowing pesticide studies to continue or for using them during the pesticide reregistration process. An EPA committee that is free from political and financial conflicts of interest should review this practice.

Abstract: The creation of nation-states in Europe has generally been assumed to be intrinsic to modernization and to be irreversible. The disintegration of Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia demonstrates that the process is not irreversible. I argue that in the case of Yugoslavia, (1) disintegration was caused by use interaction between domestic policies with regard to nationalities and integration into the global economy and (2) the impact of the disintegration of the federation on health care and public health systems has been profound. Improving and converging measures of mortality before the collapse gave way to increasing disparities afterward. The lesson is that processes of individual and social modernization do not result in improvements in health and well-being that are necessarily irreversible or shared equally.

I have analyzed these organizations' political context, their leaders, the methodologies and technologies associated with the primary health care perspective, and the debates on the meaning of primary health care. These debates led to the development of an alternative, more restricted approach, known as selective primary health care. My study examined library and archival sources; I cite examples from Latin America.

I also describe the lesser-known developments that were taking place in the Christian Medical Commission at the same time, developments that greatly enhanced the case for primary health care within WHO and its subsequent support by nongovernmental organizations concerned with community health.

I examine the unfolding of policies at different levels of administration and the roles played by a wide range of national and international actors. A careful examination of unpublished official correspondence, on which this article is largely based, shows that the program's managers were divided and that this division determined the timing of the achievement of eradication. This material also reveals that Indian health workers and bureaucrats were far more capable of reshaping policies in specific localities, often in response to local infrastractural and political concerns, than has been acknowledged in the historiography.

Abstract: The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) has in many ways been remarkably successful in revitalizing the international coalition of institutions and organizations concerned with getting vaccines to the children of the poorest countries. Many have seen this high-profile venture in public-private cooperation as a model for other groups concerned with more effectively helping to solve health problems in the developing world. We examined major flaws in the GAVI and argue that in fact the alliance does not represent a new paradigm for international public health. However, the experience of the GAVI may suggest an alternative, and more effective, way to conceptualize future global initiatives.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined disparities in smoking cessation rates between African Americans and Whites from 1990 through 2000. Methods. We performed an analysis of smoking cessation with data from the National Health Interview Surveys of 30660 African Americans and 209828 Whites, 18 to 64 years old, with adjustment for covariates in multiple logistic regression models. Results. Whites were significantly more likely than African Americans to be former smokers, and this disparity in the quit ratio persisted from 1990 through 2000. After adjustment for covariates, disparities were substantially reduced especially among women. Among former smokers, African Americans were significantly more likely than Whites to have quit successfully within the past 10 years. Conclusions. Statistical adjustment for covariates reduces African American-White disparities in quit ratios, and recent cessation patterns suggest possible future reductions in disparities.

Abstract: Objectives. We analyzed the relationship between macroeconomic conditions, measured as unemployment rate and social security spending, from 4 social security schemes and total spending due to sickness and disability. Methods. We obtained aggregated panel data from 13 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries for 1980-1996. We used regression analysis and fixed effect models to examine spending on sickness benefits, disability pensions, occupational-injury benefits, survivor's pensions, and total spending. Results. A decline in unemployment increased sickness benefits spending and reduced disability pension spending. These effects reversed direction after 4 years of unemployment. Inclusion of mortality rate as an additional variable in the analysis did not affect the findings. Conclusions. Macroeconomic conditions influence some reimbursements from social security schemes but not total spending.

Abstract: Objectives. We estimated the prevalence of cigarette smoking and the extent of environmental tobacco smoke exposure (ETS) in the general population in China. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a nationally representative sample of 15 540 Chinese adults aged 35-74 years in 2000-2001. Information on cigarette smoking was obtained by trained interviewers using a standard questionnaire. Results. The prevalence of current cigarette smoking was much higher among men (60.2%) than among women (6.9%). Among nonsmokers, 12.1% of men and 51.3% of women reported exposure to ETS at home, and 26.7% of men and 26.2% of women reported exposure to ETS in their workplaces. On the basis of our findings, 147 358 000 Chinese men and 15 895 000 Chinese women aged 35-74 years were current cigarette smokers, 8 658 000 men and 108 402 000 women were exposed to ETS at home, and 19 072 000 men and 55 372 000 women were exposed to ETS in their workplaces. Conclusions. The high prevalence of cigarette smoking and environmental tobacco smoke exposure in the Chinese population indicates an urgent need for smoking prevention and cessation efforts.

Abstract: Objectives. We assessed the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (≥10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood), risk factors, and previous blood lead testing among children in 2 high-risk Chicago, III, communities. Methods. Through high-intensity targeted screening, blood lead levels were tested and risks were assessed among a representative sample of children aged 1 to 5 years who were at risk for lead exposure. Results. Of the 539 children who were tested, 27% had elevated blood lead levels, and 61% had never been tested previously. Elevated blood lead levels were associated with chipped exterior house paint. Conclusions. Most of the children who lived in these communities - where the prevalence for elevated blood lead levels among children was 12 times higher than the national prevalence - were not tested for lead poisoning. Our findings highlight the need for targeted community outreach that includes testing blood lead levels in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendations.

Abstract: Objectives. We documented inequitable, cumulative environmental risk exposure and health between predominantly White low-income and middle-income children residing in rural areas in upstate New York. Methods. Cross-sectional data for 216 third- through fifth-grade children included overnight urinary neuroendocrine levels, noise levels, residential crowding (people/room), and housing quality. Results. After control for income, maternal education, family structure, age, and gender, cumulative environmental risk exposure (0-3) (risk > 1 SD above the mean for each singular risk factor [0, 1]) was substantially greater for low-income children. Cumulative environmental risk was positively correlated with elevated overnight epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol in the low-income sample but not in the middle-income sample. Conclusions. Cumulative environmental risk exposure among low-income families may contribute to bad health, beginning in early childhood.

Abstract: Infectious diseases are responsible for approximately 25% of global mortality, especially in children aged younger than 5 years. Much of the burden of infectious diseases could be alleviated if appropriate mechanisms could be put in place to ensure access for all children to basic vaccines, regardless of geographical location or economic status. In addition, new safe and effective vaccines should be developed for a variety of infections against which no effective preventive intervention measure is either available or practical. The public, private, and philanthropic sectors need to join forces to ensure that these new or improved vaccines are fully developed and become accessible to the populations in need as quickly as possible.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the association of local restaurant and bar regulations with self-reported exposure to environmental tobacco smoke among adults. Methods. Data were derived from a telephone survey involving a random sample of Massachusetts households. Results. Compared with adults from towns with no restaurant smoking restrictions, those from towns with strong regulations had more than twice the odds of reporting nonexposure to environmental tobacco smoke (odds ratio [OR] = 2,74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.97, 3.80), and those from towns with some restrictions had 1,62 times the odds of reporting nonexposure (OR = 1,62; 95% CI = 1.29, 2.02). Bar smoking bans had even greater effects on exposure. Conclusions. Strong local clean indoor air regulations were associated with lower levels of reported exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in restaurants and bars.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to determine how risk factors for disease vary among Asian subgroups. Methods. Using data from a case-control study conducted at Northern California Kaiser Medical Centers (from 1996 to 2001), we compared prevalence of selected risk factors among Asian subgroups and evaluated the associations of these risk factors with sociodemographic factors. Results. Chinese and Japanese patients had a lower body mass index (kg/m2) than did other Asians. In all subgroups, being born in the United States was associated with having a body mass index greater than 25 kg/m2. Compared with other Asians, more Japanese and multiple-race Asians smoked, and more Filipino and multiple-race Asian smokers started smoking at 18 years or younger. Filipinos and multiple-race Asians also were more likely to report diabetes. Conclusions. These data support the importance of efforts to distinguish among Asian subgroups in public health practice and research.

Abstract: Objectives. We used several different guidelines for appropriate alcohol use to identify patterns of high-risk alcohol consumption among older women and men and examined associations between these patterns and late-life alcohol use problems. Methods. A sample of 1291 older adults participated in a survey of alcohol consumption and alcohol use problems and was studied again 10 years later. Results. Depending on the guideline, 23% to 50% of women and 29% to 45% of men engaged in potentially unsafe alcohol use patterns. The likelihood of risky alcohol use declined over the 10 years; however, the numbers of drinks consumed per week and per day were associated with alcohol use problems at both assessment intervals. Conclusion. Our findings imply that guidelines for alcohol consumption should be no more liberal for older men than for older women.

Abstract: In the United States, injuries are the leading cause of death among individuals aged 1 to 45 years and the fourth leading cause of death overall. Rural populations exhibit disproportionately high injury mortality rates. Deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes, traumatic occupational injuries, drowning, residential fires, and suicide all increase with increasing rurality. We describe differences in rates and patterns of injury among rural and urban populations and discuss factors that contribute to these differences.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to determine the association of depression and anxiety with "area deprivation" (neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation) and population density among people older than 75 years in Britain. Methods. Postal codes were used to link census area information to individual data on depression and anxiety in 13349 people aged 75 years and older taking part in a trial of health screening. Results. Living in the most socioeconomically deprived areas was associated with depression (OR = 1.4), but this relation disappeared after adjusting for individual deprivation characteristics. There was no association with anxiety. Living in the highest density and intermediate low-density areas was associated with depression (OR = 1.6 and 1.5) and anxiety (OR = 1.5 and 1.3) compared with the lowest density areas. Conclusions. An association between area deprivation and depression in older people was explained by individual health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors. Higher population density was consistently associated with increased depression and anxiety.

Abstract: Objectives. We tested the assumption that average job retention duration is shorter for physicians in rural health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) than for physicians in rural non-HPSAs. Methods. In 1991, we surveyed nationally representative samples of primary care physicians who recently had moved to rural HPSAs and non-HPSAs who were without service obligations. We resurveyed these physicians in 1996 and 1997 to learn of any job changes. Results. Physicians in rural HPSAs (n = 308) demonstrated retention similar to that of the non-HPSA cohort (n = 197) (hazard ratio for leaving = 1.28; 95% confidence interval = 0.97, 1.69; P = .08), even with adjustments for group demographic differences (P= .24). Conclusions. Average retention duration for generalist physicians in rural HPSAs is identical to or slightly shorter than for those in rural non-HPSAs. Poor recruitment is likely to be the principal dynamic underlying local rural shortages.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to determine whether disparities in health-related quality of life exist between veterans who live in rural settings and their suburban or urban counterparts. Methods. We determined health-related quality-of-life scores (physical and mental health component summaries) for 767 109 veterans who had used Veterans Health Administration services within the past 3 years. We used rural/urban commuting area codes to categorize veterans into rural, suburban, or urban residence. Results. Health-related quality-of-life scores were significantly lower for veterans who lived in rural settings than for those who lived in suburban or urban settings. Rural veterans had significantly more physical health comorbidities, but fewer mental health comorbidities, than their suburban and urban counterparts. Rural-urban disparities persisted in all survey subscales, across regional delivery networks, and after we controlled for sociodemographic factors. Conclusions. When compared with their urban and suburban counterparts, veterans who live in a rural setting have worse health-related quality-of-life scores. Policymakers, within and outside the Veterans Health Administration, should anticipate greater health care demands from rural populations.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined differences in quality of care among nursing homes in locales of varying degrees of rurality. Methods. We classified locales into 4 classes according to rurality. We analyzed a 10% sample of nursing home admissions in the United States in 2000 (n = 198613) to estimate survival models for 9 quality indicators. Results. For postacute admissions, we observed significant differences in rates of decline for residents in facilities in large towns compared with urban areas, but differences in quality were both negative and positive. Among admissions for long-term or chronic care, rates of decline in 2 of 9 quality areas were lower for residents in isolated areas. Conclusions. We observed significant differences in a number of quality indicators among different classes of nursing home locations, but differences varied dramatically according to type of admission. These differences did not exhibit the monotonicity that we would have expected had they derived solely from rurality. Also, quality indicators exhibited more similarities than differences across the 4 classes of locales. The results underscore the importance, in some instances, of emphasizing the effects of specific settings rather than some continuum of rurality and of moving beyond the assumption that nursing home residents constitute a homogeneous population.

Remarkable health inequalities existed and favored the higher educational groups; among women, the inequalities were greater and health inequalities increased from 1993 to 2001. Education serves as a more powerful mediating factor for health inequalities among women than among men in rural China.

Abstract: In this commentary, I place the maturing field of rural health research and policy in the context of the rural health disparities documented in Health United States, 2001, Urban and Rural Health Chartbook. Because of recent advances in our understanding of the determinants of health, the field must branch out from its traditional focus on access to health care services toward initiatives that are based on models of population health. In addition to presenting distinct regional differences, the chartbook shows a pattern of risky health behaviors among rural populations that suggest a "rural culture" health determinant. This pattern suggests that there may be environmental and cultural factors unique to towns, regions, or United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) economic types that affect health behavior and health.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to identify predictors of beginning and ending caregiving. Methods. At baseline and 3-year follow-up, we interviewed 4245 community residents (61.4% Black, 38.4% White, 0.20% other) aged 65 years or older. We used logistic regression to test predictors of beginning caregiving among baseline noncaregivers and of continuing caregiving among baseline caregivers. Results. After control for demographic variables, physically healthier individuals were significantly more likely to become caregivers and to continue caregiving. Mental health had little influence on beginning caregiving, but declining mental heath was associated with continuing caregiving. Conclusions. Maintenance of physical health and function is essential to the ability of older adults to begin and to continue caregiving. Studies that compare the health of current caregivers with that of noncaregivers may substantially under-estimate the impact of caregiving on health.

Abstract: Bioterrorism preparedness programs have contributed to death, illness, and waste of public health resources without evidence of benefit. Several deaths and many serious illnesses have resulted from the smallpox vaccination program; yet there is no clear evidence that a threat of smallpox exposure ever existed. The anthrax spores released in 2001 have been linked to secret US military laboratories-the resultant illnesses and deaths might not have occurred if those laboratories were not in operation. The present expansion of bioterrorism preparedness programs will continue to squander health resources, increase the dangers of accidental or purposeful release of dangerous pathogens, and further undermine efforts to enforce international treaties to ban biological and chemical weapons. The public health community should acknowledge the substantial harm that bioterrorism preparedness has already caused and develop mechanisms to increase our public health resources and to allocate them to address the world's real health needs.

Abstract: Something is afoot in south central Idaho. After 2 years of work, the percentage of people with diabetes receiving recommended annual foot examinations has increased by 13.8%, exceeding the state average. This turnaround, from being the region with the lowest percentage of foot examinations in the state, was made possible when South Central District Health joined diabetes coalition members to develop a comprehensive program that maximizes limited resources in the rural, 8-county service area. Key program components include (1) development of a curriculum on CD-ROM called 2 Minute Diabetes Foot Examination, (2) training area physicians and nurses in the curriculum, (3) incorporating the curriculum into the nursing program at the local college, (4) offering free foot-screening clinics to targeted populations, and (5) conducting public education and outreach.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated lifestyle interventions for diabetic persons who live in rural communities. Methods. We conducted a 12-month randomized clinical trial (n = 152) of "intensive-lifestyle" (modeled after the NIH Diabetes Prevention Program) and "reimbursable-lifestyle" (intensive-lifestyle intervention delivered in the time allotted for Medicare reimbursement for diabetes education related to nutrition and physical activity) interventions with usual care as a control. Results. Modest weight loss occurred by 6 months among intensive-lifestyle participants and was greater than the weight loss among usual-care participants (2.6kg vs 0.4 kg, P<.01). At 12 months, a greater proportion of intensive-lifestyle participants had lost 2 kg or more than usual-care participants (49% vs 25%, P<.05). No differences in weight change were observed between reimbursable-lifestyle and usual-care participants. Glycated hemoglobin was reduced among all groups (P<.05) but was not different between groups. Conclusions. Improvement in both weight and glycemia was attainable by lifestyle interventions designed for persons who had type 2 diabetes and lived in rural communities.

Abstract: Objectives. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of a rural youth health and safety initiative implemented in 4000 National FFA (formerly Future Farmers of America) chapters across the United States. Methods. Data were collected from high school students and their FFA advisers at 3 time intervals (preintervention, immediate postintervention, and 1 year postintervention) with a 3-group (standard, enhanced, and control), cluster-randomized, controlled trial design. Results. Matched data from 3081 students and 81 advisers revealed no significant effect of this initiative on agricultural health and safety knowledge, safety attitudes, leadership, self-concept, and self-reported injuries of project participants. Data from 30 public health nurses following the intervention confirmed the program's failure to develop sustainable community partnerships. Conclusions. This nationally coordinated initiative was funded with more than $1 million donated by agribusinesses. Program implementation was inconsistent, and desired outcomes were not achieved. Future efforts should better guide effective use of private sector resources aimed at reducing agricultural disease and injury among rural youths.

Abstract: Rural racial/ethnic minorities constitute a forgotten population. The limited research addressing rural Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native populations suggests that disparities in health and in health care access found among rural racial/ethnic minority populations are generally more severe than those among urban racial/ethnic minorities. We suggest that disparities must be understood as both collective and contextual phenomena. Rural racial/ethnic minority disparities in part stem from the aggregation of disadvantaged individuals in rural areas. Disparities also emerge from a context of limited educational and economic opportunity. Linking public health planning to the education and economic development sectors will reduce racial/ethnic minority disparities while increasing overall well-being in rural communities.

Abstract: In September 2003, the Association of Schools of Public Health administered an online survey to representatives of all 33 accredited US schools of public health. The survey assessed the extent to which the schools were offering curriculum content in the 8 areas recommended by the Institute of Medicine: communication, community-based participatory research, cultural competence, ethics, genomics, global health, informatics, and law/policy. Findings indicated that, for the most part, schools of public health are offering content in these areas through many approaches and have incorporated various aspects of a broad-based ecological approach to public health education and training. The findings also suggested the possible need for greater content in genomics, informatics, community-based participatory research, and cultural competence.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined whether Mexican Americans living in high-density Mexican American neighborhoods experience increased morbidity and mortality compared with the rates observed among Mexican Americans living in low-density areas. Methods. We conducted a prospective analysis of a cohort of 3050 Mexican Americans aged 65 years or older. We examined prevalence of 6 medical conditions and survival over 7 years of follow-up in relation to percentage of Mexican Americans in the census tract. Results. With adjustment for covariates, odds for disease prevalence among older Mexican Americans as a function of percentage of Mexican Americans in the census tract were 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16, 0.71) for stroke, 0.28 (95% CI = 0.11, 0.70) for cancer, and 0.31 (95% CI = 0.10, 0.98) for hip fracture. The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality over 7 years' follow-up was 0.64 (95% CI = 0.42, 0.96). Conclusions. Sociocultural advantages conferred on Mexican Americans by living in high-density Mexican American neighborhoods outweigh the disadvantages conferred by the high poverty of those neighborhoods.

Abstract: Afghanistan's health system is severely limited in terms of preventive and curative services, referral systems, and human resources. Most of the country's citizens reside in rural areas, a majority of which are served by "basic health units" (small and simple facilities that provide primary care), and these rural residents face additional challenges regarding timely access to quality health care. The analysis described in this article, which focuses on data derived from 2 rural health units during a 1-year period, revealed that infectious diseases, mainly acute respiratory infections, were a primary concern and that there is a clear need for increasing access to health services. In addition, our results showed that women are underrepresented as patients and appear to be at higher risk than men of tuberculosis.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated self-perceived access to health care in a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries. Methods. We identified patterns of use and barriers to health care from self-administered questionnaires collected during the 1993-1994 annual examination of the Cardiovascular Health Study. Results. The questionnaires were completed by 4889 (91.1%) participants, with a mean age of 76.0 years. The most common barriers to seeing a physician were the doctor's lack of responsiveness to patient concerns, medical bills, transportation, and street safety. Low income, no supplemental insurance, older age, and female gender were independently related to perceptions of barriers. Race was not significant after adjustment for other factors. Conclusions. Psychological and physical barriers affect access to care among the elderly; these may be influenced by poverty more than by race.

Abstract: Objectives. We tested the effectiveness of a community-based lay health advisor intervention for primary prevention of lead poisoning among Native American children who lived in a former mining area. Methods. We conducted cross-sectional population-based blood lead assessments of Native American and White children aged 1 to 6 years and in-person caregiver interviews before (n = 331) and after (n = 387) a 2-year intervention. Results. Mean childhood blood lead levels decreased and selected preventive behaviors improved for both Native American and White (comparison) communities. Several short-term outcomes also improved from pre- to postintervention, but only knowledge and hand-washing self-efficacy increased more among Native Americans than among Whites. Conclusions. Our findings provide limited support for the effectiveness of lay health advisor interventions as a primary lead poisoning prevention strategy for Native American communities.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the prevalence of endoscopy (sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) by indication and by demographic and lifestyle factors. Methods. We analyzed cross-sectional data collected in 1997 from participants aged 50 years and older in the Cancer Prevention Study (CPS) II Nutrition Cohort. Results. Fifty-eight percent of men and 51% of women reported ever having undergone endoscopy; only 42% of men and 31% of women reported endoscopy for screening rather than for disease diagnosis or follow-up. Prevalence varied by demographic and lifestyle factors. Conclusions. Efforts to increase colorectal cancer screening need to target women, all persons aged 50-64 years, and those with colorectal cancer risk factors. Future studies should distinguish endoscopy for screening from procedures for disease diagnosis and follow-up to avoid overestimating screening compliance.

Currently, clinics provide free or low-cost care, and schools, public health, social services, and religious organizations connect Latinos to the health care system. However, many unmet health care needs result from lack of health insurance, limited income, and linguistic and cultural barriers. Targeted safety net funding would help meet Latino health care needs in rural communities with limited resources.

Abstract: We examined differences in health measures among rural, suburban, and urban residents and factors that contribute to these differences. Whereas differences between rural and urban residents were observed for some health measures, a consistent rural-to-urban gradient was not always found. Often, the most rural and the most urban areas were found to be disadvantaged compared with suburban areas. If health disparities are to be successfully addressed, the relationship between place of residence and health must be understood.

Abstract: Objectives. We used 1997 Medicare data to replicate an earlier study that used data from 1986 to examine racial differences in usage of specific medical procedures or tests among elderly persons. Methods. We used 1997 physician claims data to obtain a random sample of 5% of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. We used this sample to study 30 procedures and tests that were analyzed in the 1986 study, as well as several new procedures that became more widely used in the early 1990s. Results. Racial differences remain in the rates of use of these procedures; in general, Blacks have lower rates of use than do Whites. Between 1986 and 1997, the ratio of White to Black use moved in favor of Blacks for all but 4 of the established procedures studied. Conclusions. The White-Black gap in health care use under Medicare is narrowing.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought information about the cost-related underuse of medications-which medications are underused, by whom, and how often. Methods. Chronically ill adults were asked to identify how often they underused prescription medication for 16 health conditions because of the cost. Results. Eighteen percent of respondents cut back on medication use owing to cost in the previous year, and 14% used less medication at least monthly. Although rates of underuse varied substantially across treatments, prescription coverage and out-of-pocket costs were determinants of underuse across medication types. Conclusions. Many chronically ill adults frequently cut back on medications owing to cost. Patients are selective about the treatments they forgo. Out-of-pocket costs and inadequate prescription coverage may lead to adherence problems for many important medication types.

Abstract: Objectives. We analyzed urban-rural differences in intentional firearm death. Methods. We analyzed 584629 deaths from 1989 to 1999 assigned to 3141 US counties, using negative binomial regressions and an 11-category urban-rural variable. Results. The most urban counties had 1.03 (95% confidence interval [Cl] = 0.87, 1.20) times the adjusted firearm death rate of the most rural counties. The most rural counties experienced 1.54 (95% Cl= 1.29, 1.83) times the adjusted firearm suicide rate of the most urban. The most urban counties experienced 1.90 (95% Cl = 1.50, 2.40) times the adjusted firearm homicide rate of the most rural. Similar opposing trends were not found for nonfirearm suicide or homicide. Conclusions. Firearm suicide in rural counties is as important a public health problem as firearm homicide in urban counties. Policymakers should become aware that intentional firearm deaths affect all types of communities in the United States.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated fatal occupational injury rates in the United States by race and Hispanic ethnicity during the period 1990-1996. Methods. Fatalities were identified by means of the national traumatic occupational fatalities surveillance system. Fatal occupational injury rates were calculated by race/ethnicity and region using US-census-based workforce estimates. Results. Non-Hispanic Black men in the South had the highest fatal occupational injury rate (8.5 per 100 000 worker-years), followed by Hispanic men in the South (7.9 per 100 000 worker-years). Fatal injury rates for Hispanic men increased over the study period, exceeding rates for non-Hispanic Black men in the latter years of observation. Conclusions. These data suggest a change in the demographics of fatal occupational injuries in the United States. Hispanic men in the South appear to be emerging as the group with the nation's highest unintentional fatal occupational injury rate.

A pre-post test design with intervention and control groups was used; outcome measures included staff perceptions of the intervention's effects on the workplace environment, their personal habits and health beliefs, and their counseling self-efficacy. Intervention site staff were more likely to report that the workplace environment supported their efforts to make healthy food choices (P < .001), be physically active (P < .01), make positive changes in counseling parents about their children's weight (P < .01), and feel more comfortable in encouraging WIC clients to do physical activities with their children (P < .05).

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated the hepatitis A virus (HAV) control policy (hygienic precautions and passive immunization with immune globulin) for "household contacts" (defined as all people who lived in the same house and who shared the same toilet with the patient, people who took care of an HAV-infected child, and sexual partners of the patient) of acute hepatitis A patients between 1996 and 2000. Methods. We examined the characteristics and the serological outcomes of household contacts. All susceptible contacts were invited for retesting 6 weeks after they received immune globulin. Results. Of 1242 contacts of 569 HAV patients, more than 50% (n = 672) were found to be HAV immune. Among the remaining contacts, 161 (28.2%) had a concurrent infection, and 86 of these individuals were symptomatic. The remaining 409 susceptible contacts received immune globulin, with 186 (45%) returning for retesting 6 weeks later (64 [34%] were infected, but only 12 had symptoms). Conclusions. Immune globulin does not protect all household contacts from HAV infection; however, it attenuates symptoms and effectively reduces further HAV transmission.

Abstract: Objectives. We estimated overweight and obesity in New York City elementary school children. Methods. A multistage cluster sample of New York City public elementary school children was selected. Nurses measured children's height and weight and used a standard protocol to determine body mass index (BMI). Demographic information was obtained from official school rosters. Overweight and obese were defined as BMI-for-age at or above the 85th and 95th percentiles, respectively. Results. Of 3069 sampled students, 2681 (87%) were measured. The prevalence of overweight was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 39%, 47%), more than half of whom were obese. Overall prevalence of obesity was 24% (95% CI = 21%, 27%), with at least 20% obesity in each grade, including kindergarten. Hispanic children had significantly higher levels (31%; 95% CI = 29%, 34%) than Black (23%; 95% CI = 18%, 28%) or White children (16%; 95% CI = 12%, 20%). Asian children had the lowest level of obesity among all racial/ethnic groups (14.4%, 95% CI = 10.9, 18.7). Conclusions. Obesity among public elementary school children in New York City is an important public health issue. Particularly high levels among Hispanic and Black children mirror national trends and are insufficiently understood.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the relation between body mass index, exercise, overall health, and physical functioning. Methods. We studied 7867 adults aged 51 to 61 years in 1992 to 1996. Adjusted relative risks for health decline and new physical difficulties were determined with logistic regression. Results. Overweight and obesity were independently associated with health decline (adjusted relative risk [ARR] = 1.29 and 1.36) and development of a new physical difficulty (ARR = 1.27 and 1.45). Regular exercise significantly reduced the risk of health decline and development of a new physical difficulty, even among obese individuals. Conclusions. Maintaining ideal body weight is important in preventing decline in overall health and physical functioning. However, regular exercise can reduce the risk of health decline even among individuals who cannot achieve ideal weight.

Abstract: Approximately 400 people die from extreme heat each year in the United States, and the risk of heat waves may increase as a result of global climate change. Despite the risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality, many cities lack written heat response plans. In a review of plans from 18 cities at risk for heat-related mortality, we found that many cities had inadequate or no heat response plans. This is an important area for further investigation and government attention.

Methods. We documented which of 173 East Harlem and 152 Upper East Side grocery stores stocked 5 recommended foods. Results. Overall, 18% of East Harlem stores stocked recommended foods, compared with 58% of stores in the Upper East Side (P<.0001). Only 9% of East Harlem bodegas (neighborhood stores) carried all items (vs 48% of Upper East Side bodegas), though East Harlem had more bodegas. East Harlem residents were more likely than Upper East Side residents (50% vs 24%) to have stores on their block that did not stock recommended foods and less likely (26% vs 30%) to have stores on their block that stocked recommended foods. Conclusions. A greater effort needs to be made to make available stores that carry diabetes-healthy foods.

Abstract: We sought to estimate the number of arrestees at risk for inadequately treated drug and alcohol withdrawal in US jails. We used Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program data to estimate prevalence rates of alcohol and opiate dependence. Our results revealed rates of alcohol and opiate dependency among arrestees of approximately 12% and 4%, respectively; only 28% of jail administrators reported that their institutions had ever detoxified arrestees. Inadequately treated drug and alcohol withdrawal in US jails appears widespread. Our data raise important ethical and constitutional questions.

Abstract: Objectives. We determined diet quality trends among nationally representative samples of preschoolers between 1977 and 1998. Methods. Adjusted diet quality index scores, overall intake, and tertiles of total score were compared for combined samples and 2 age groups using t tests with Bonferroni correction; surveys used were the US Department of Agriculture's National Food Consumption Survey 1977-1979 (n=2342), Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII) 1989-1991 (n=858), and CSFII 1994-1996 and 1998 (n=5355). Results. Total scores increased slightly. Consumption of grains, fruits, and vegetables improved while added sugar and juice intake worsened. Conclusions. Diet quality improved marginally since 1977. Consumption of fruits and vegetables needs to be increased and that of total and saturated fat, juice, and added sugar decreased.

Abstract: We examined how perceived need for workplace accommodation affects labor-force participation in people with disabilities. We analyzed a Canadian survey with structural equation modeling to test a model incorporating activity limitations and perceived need for workplace accommodations. The results suggested that the effect of upper- and lower-body activity limitation on labor-force participation was mediated by perceived need for workplace accommodations. Thus, the provision of adequate workplace accommodations could enhance labor-force participation in people with disabilities.

Abstract: Objectives. We conducted a population-based telephone survey in an attempt to determine correlates of formal and informal help seeking after September 11, 2001. Methods. Between October 15 and December 31, 2001, 1774 Connecticut Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System respondents were asked questions directly related to their experiences of September 11. Results. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that receipt of formal help was predicted by sleep problems, close association with a victim, reports of increased smoking or drinking, and receipt of informal help. Age, gender, reports of 1 or more problems, and formal help seeking predicted receipt of informal help. Conclusions. Public health planning and bioterrorism preparedness should include programs addressing increased smoking and drinking, sleep problems, and bereavement in the wake of disasters.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined lengths of hospital stay among individuals categorized according to weight status. Methods. We used data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Followup Survey to estimate length-of-stay differences. Results. Individuals with body mass indexes (BMIs) of 35 kg/m2 or above, those with BMIs of 30 to 34 kg/m2, and those with BMIs of 25 to 29 kg/m2 had crude length-of-stay rates greater than those of normal-weight individuals. Association between BMI and length of stay varied overtime. Conclusions. Obese individuals experience longer hospital stays than normal-weight individuals.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the association between diet quality and estimated diet costs. Methods. Freely chosen diets of 837 French adults were assessed by a dietary history method. Mean national food prices for 57 foods were used to estimate diet costs. Results. Diets high in fat, sugar, and grains were associated with lower diet costs after adjustment for energy intakes, gender, and age. For most levels of energy intake, each additional 100 g of fats and sweets was associated with a €0.05-0.40 per day reduction in diet costs. In contrast, each additional 100 g of fruit and vegetables was associated with a €0.18-0.29 per day increase in diet costs. Conclusions. Diets high in fats and sweets represent a low-cost option to the consumer, whereas the recommended "prudent" diets cost more.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the impact of relatively "green" or natural settings on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms across diverse subpopulations of children. Methods. Parents nationwide rated the aftereffects of 49 common after-school and weekend activities on children's symptoms. Aftereffects were compared for activities conducted in green outdoor settings versus those conducted in both built outdoor and indoor settings. Results. In this national, nonprobability sample, green outdoor activities reduced symptoms significantly more than did activities conducted in other settings, even when activities were matched across settings. Findings were consistent across age, gender, and income groups; community types; geographic regions; and diagnoses. Conclusions. Green outdoor settings appear to reduce ADHD symptoms in children across a wide range of individual, residential, and case characteristics.

Abstract: Objectives. We described changes in body mass index (BMI) and the prevalence of thinness among young Japanese women (aged 15-29 years) from 1976 to 2000 by reanalyzing the nationwide data in the National Nutrition Survey, Japan. Methods. We used height and weight data sets for 30903 nonpregnant, non-lactating women during the 25-year period. We calculated the mean values of BMI and the prevalence of thinness for 3 age groups (15-19, 20-24, and 25-29 years of age). Results. Changes in BMI per 10 years were -0.17 kg/m2, -0.22 kg/m2, and -0.34 kg/m2 for each age group, respectively. Extreme thinness (BMI &lt; 17 kg/m2) increased from 2.4% in 1976-1980 to 4.2% in 1996-2000. Conclusions. Further studies regarding topics such as increased smoking prevalence are needed to identify the underlying causes of increasing thinness.

Abstract: Objective. We evaluated the characteristics of French subjects meeting current public health recommendations for physical activity. Methods. We assessed leisure-time physical activity cross-sectionally in 7404 adults aged 45 to 68 years with applied logistic regression models. Results. Meeting the recommended physical activity levels was more likely in subjects aged 60 years and older and in women with higher education levels or living in rural areas and was less likely in smokers. No association was found with time spent watching television. The contribution of vigorous activity to total time spent being active was approximately 2 times higher in subjects meeting recommendations. Conclusions. Participation in some vigorous activity may be viewed as a "facilitator" to attain physical activity recommendations. Relationships with physical environment variables in Europe need further investigation.

Abstract: Objectives. We compared reports of deaths in which tobacco use was a contributing factor ("tobacco-associated deaths") before and after the addition to death certificates in Texas of a check-box question asking whether tobacco use contributed to an individual's death. Methods. We examined Texas vital statistics files from 1987 to 1998. We calculated differences in percentages of reported tobacco-associated deaths (and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for the periods 1987 to 1992, before the addition of the check-box question, and 1993 to 1998, after the additon of the check-box. Results. Reports of tobacco-associated deaths were significantly less frequent before addition of the check-box question (0.7%; 95% CI = 0.4%, 1.0%) than after addition of the question (13.9%; 95% CI = 13.0%, 14.7%). From 1993 to 1998, percentages of tobacco-associated deaths reported on the check-box question increased steadily. Conclusions. The addition of a tobacco-associated-death check box on Texas death certificates significantly increased reporting of tobacco use contributions to mortality.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the associations among early-adolescent substance use, subsequent young-adult substance use disorders, and psychiatric disorders among a community sample of males. Methods. Early-adolescent data were collected in classroom surveys (1990-1993), and young-adult data were collected in face-to-face interviews (1998-2000). Results. We found strong associations between early-adolescent substance use and young-adult substance use disorders and psychiatric disorders. The magnitudes of these associations varied by racial/ethnic group and were strongest among African Americans and foreign-born Hispanics, who reported the lowest early-adolescent substance use. Conclusions. Early-adolescent substance use is most strongly associated with a later pattern of dysfunction among the racial/ethnic groups that reported the lowest levels of early use. The implications of our findings in the context of primary and secondary prevention are discussed.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated the relationship between breastfeeding, asthma and atopy, and child body mass index (BMI). Methods. From a prospective birth cohort (n = 2860) in Perth, Western Australia, 2195 children were followed up to age 6 years. Asthma was defined as doctor-diagnosed asthma and wheeze in the last year, and atopy was determined by skin prick test of 1596 children. Breastfeeding, BMI, asthma, and atopy were regressed allowing for confounders and the propensity score for overweight. Results. Using fractional polynomials, we found no association between breastfeeding and overweight. Less exclusive breastfeeding was associated with increased asthma and atopy, and BMI increased with asthma. Conclusions. Less exclusive breastfeeding leads to increases in child asthma and atopy and a higher BMI is a risk factor for asthma.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the effect of physical education instruction time on body mass index (BMI) change in elementary school. Methods. We examined data from a national sample of 9751 kindergartners in the United States who were reported on for 2 years. We used a difference-indifferences approach to examine the effect of an increase in physical education instruction time between kindergarten and first grade on the difference in BMI change in the 2 grades, using the same child as the control. Results. One additional hour of physical education in first grade compared with the time allowed for physical education in kindergarten reduces BMI among girls who were overweight or at risk for overweight in kindergarten (coefficient=-0.31, P<.001) but has no significant effect among overweight or at-risk-for-overweight boys (coefficient=-0.07, P=.25) or among boys (coefficient=0.04, P=.31) or girls (coefficient=0.01, P=.80) with a normal BMI. Conclusions. Expanding physical education programs in schools, in the form in which they currently exist, may be an effective intervention for combating obesity in the early years, especially among girls.

Abstract: Objectives. We assessed changes in body mass index (BMI) among Brazilian adolescents. Methods. In 1975, 1989, and 1997, we conducted household surveys of the weights and statures of a probabilistic sample of about 50000 Brazilian adolescents aged 10 to 19 years. Weighted prevalences were calculated and an analysis was performed with the sample design taken into account. Results. Adolescents of rich (southeast) and poor (northeast) regions showed a substantial increase in BMI. In the southeast, the prevalence of overweight, defined by international age- and gender-specific BMI cutoffs, for both genders reached 17% in 1997, whereas in the northeast, the prevalence tripled, reaching 5% among boys and 12% among girls. Older girls living in urban areas in the southeast showed a decrease in prevalence from 16% to 13% in the latter 2 surveys. For all boys and for young girls, the BMI values for the 85th percentile in 1997 were much higher than the 95th percentile values in 1975. Conclusions. BMI increased dramatically in Brazilian adolescents, mainly among boys; among older girls from the richest region, the prevalence of overweight is decreasing.

Abstract: Estimates of deaths attributable to obesity in the United States rely on estimates from epidemiological cohorts of the relative risk of mortality associated with obesity. However, these relative risk estimates are not necessarily appropriate for the total US population, in part because of exclusions to control for baseline health status and exclusion or underrepresentation of older adults. Most deaths occur among older adults; estimates of deaths attributable to obesity can vary widely depending on the assumptions about the relative risks of mortality associated with obesity among the elderly. Thus, it may be difficult to estimate deaths attributable to obesity with adequate accuracy and precision. We urge efforts to improve the data and methods for estimating this statistic.

Abstract: Objectives. I examined the association between urban sprawl and the risk for being overweight or obese among US adults. Methods. A measure of urban sprawl in metropolitan areas was derived from the 2000 US Census; individual-level data were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. I used multilevel analysis to assess the association between urban sprawl and obesity. Results. After I controlled for gender, age, race/ethnicity, income, and education, for each 1-point rise in the urban sprawl index (0-100 scale), the risk for being overweight increased by 0.2% and the risk for being obese increased by 0.5%. Conclusions. The current obesity epidemic has many causes, but there is an association between urban sprawl and obesity.

Abstract: Objectives. This field study tested the feasibility and benefits of a program to promote 6 targeted parental behaviors to prevent obesity in children served by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Methods. Two WIC sites participated in a nonrandomized, controlled 1-year prospective study to assess parents' self-reported behavior changes. Results. Statistical analyses of preintervention and postintervention assessments of parental behavior demonstrated significant changes in 2 behaviors: frequency of offering the child water and frequency of engaging in active play with the child. In both cases, the intervention proved effective in increasing the desired behavior. Conclusions. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of changing parental behaviors through multidimensional education in a WIC clinic setting.

Twenty secondary schools were randomly assigned to either an environmental intervention or a control group for a 2-year period. The intervention increased the availability of lower-fat foods and implemented student-based promotions. Results. A steeper rate of increase in sales of lower-fat foods in year 1 (10% intervention vs -2.8% control, P=.002) and a higher percentage of sales of lower-fat foods in year 2 (33.6% intervention vs 22.1% control, P=.04) were observed. There were no significant changes in student self-reported food choices. Conclusions. School-based environmental interventions to increase availability and promotion of lower-fat foods can increase purchase of these foods among adolescents.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to assess the effects of a school-based intervention program on cardiovascular disease risk factors in urban girls. Methods. We compared heart health knowledge, health behaviors, cardiovascular risk factors, and physical fitness among a group of 442 multiethnic teenaged girls (310 experimental participants vs 132 control participants). Testing was conducted before and after a 12-week program of vigorous exercises integrated with lectures and discussions on diet, exercise, stress, and smoking. Results. Significant differences in body fat, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart health knowledge, and whether breakfast was eaten were observed between experimental participants and control participants. Conclusions. An integrated program of exercise and heart health-related lectures and discussions had a beneficial effect on health knowledge, health behaviors, and onset of risk factors for coronary artery disease among urban girls.

We assessed long-term trends in ethylene oxide (EtO) worker exposures for the purposes of exposure surveillance and evaluation of the impacts of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 1984 and 1988 EtO standards. Methods. We obtained exposure data from a large commercial vendor and processor of EtO passive dosimeters. Personal samples (87 582 workshift [8-hr] and 46 097 short-term [15-min] samples) from 2265 US hospitals were analyzed for time trends from 1984 through 2001 and compared with OSHA enforcement data. Results. Exposures declined steadily for the first several years after the OSHA standards were set. Workshift exposures continued to taper off and have remained low and constant through 2001. However, since 1996, the probability of exceeding the short-term excursion limit has increased. This trend coincides with a decline in enforcement of the EtO standard. Conclusions. Results indicate the need for renewed intervention efforts to preserve gains made following the passage and implementation of the 1984 and 1988 EtO standards.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined whether Latinas differ from non-Latinas in having undergone recent mammography, clinical breast examination, or Papanicolaou testing, as well as the contribution of sociodemographic and health care variables to screening. Methods. We used data from the 1991 National Health Interview Survey Health Promotion and Disease Prevention supplement. Results. Latinas were less likely than non-Latina Whites to have undergone mammography (odds ratio [OR]=0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] =0.57, 0.88), but this difference was attenuated when we controlled for socioeconomic factors (OR=0.90; 95% CI=0.70, 1.15). Latinas did not differ from Whites on Papanicolaou tests or clinical breast examinations. Quality of and access to health care predicted screening. Conclusions. Latina ethnicity does not predict breast and cervical cancer screening behavior independent of sociodemographic and structural factors.

Abstract: Four years have passed since the institution of the cease-fire in Yugoslavia, and questions remain as to how Kosovar women are faring in the country's postwar reconstruction. Reports, albeit fragmented, suggest that violence against women began to increase in 1998 and 1999. This trend continued through 2001, even while rates of other major crimes decreased. Despite considerable local efforts to address the conditions of women, there remains a lack of systematic data documenting the scope and frequency of violent acts committed against women. A centralized surveillance system focused on tracking human rights abuses needs to be established to address this critical need for empirically based reports and to ultimately guide reform efforts.

Abstract: Among 684 sexually active women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) followed up for a mean of 35 months, we related contraceptive use to self-reported PID recurrence, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. Persistent use of condoms during the study reduced the risk of recurrent PID, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. Consistent condom use (about 60% of encounters) at baseline also reduced these risks, after adjustment for confounders, by 30% to 60%. Self-reported persistent and consistent condom use was associated with lower rates of PID sequelae.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined within-person associations between changes in family income and women's depressive symptoms during the first 3 years after childbirth. Methods. Data were analyzed for 1351 women (mean baseline age=28.13 years) who participated in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care. Nineteen percent of these women belonged to an ethnic minority, and 35% were poor at some time during the study. Results. Changes in income and poverty status were significantly associated with changes in depressive symptoms. Effects were greatest for chronically poor women and for women who perceived fewer costs associated with their employment. Conclusions. Given that women head most poor households in the United States, our findings indicate that reductions in poverty would have mental health benefits for women and families.

Abstract: Objective. We assessed the quality of hospital care for women who underwent a hysterectomy to compare Medicaid-covered women with privately insured women and minority women with White women. Methods. We evaluated medical decisions, inpatient care, quality of inpatient care, and outcomes. Results. Quality of hospital care was equivalent for Medicaid-covered women compared with privately insured women and for non-Hispanic Black women compared with White women. Medicaid-covered women (40%) and Black women (68%) were more likely to have a complication compared with privately insured women and White women, respectively. Conclusions. Increased complications after hysterectomy may result in increased economic burdens to Medicaid. Further studies of the racial/ethnic and sociodemographic issues are needed so that disparities may be adequately addressed.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated the impact of health care system changes on nurses' health, and we studied reported musculoskeletal disorders associated with these changes. Methods. This cross-sectional study (n = 1163) defined a musculoskeletal disorder case as moderate pain that lasted at least 1 week or occurred monthly during the past year. Nurses were asked about changes in the health care system in the past year, and responses to 12 changes were summed and were categorized as low, moderate, or high changes. Results. When the changes were summed, the adjusted odds ratios for musculoskeletal disorders for more than 6 versus 0 to 1 changes were (1) neck: 4.45 (95% confidence interval [Cl] = 1.97, 10.08), (2) shoulder: 2.63 (95% Cl = 1.17, 5.91), and (3) back: 3.42 (95% Cl = 1.61, 7.27). Conclusions. The adverse impact on health caused by the changing health care system must be addressed to prevent further injuries among nurses.

Abstract: A review of internal tobacco company documents showed that the tobacco company Philip Morris and the insurance company CIGNA collaborated to censor accurate information on the harm of smoking and on environmental tobacco smoke exposure from CIGNA health newsletters sent to employees of Philip Morris and its affiliates. From 1996 to 1998, 5 of the 8 CIGNA newsletters discussed in the internal tobacco documents were censored. We recommend that accrediting bodies mandate that health plans not censor employee-directed health information at the request of employers.

Pages: 1347-1351
Abstract: Objectives. I examined the effect of imposing a requirement for parental consent before minors can receive medical contraceptives. Methods. Birth and abortions among teens, relative to adults, in a suburban Illinois county that imposed a parental consent requirement in 1998 were compared with births and abortions in nearby counties during the period 1997-2000. Results. The relative proportion of births to women under age 19 years in the county rose significantly compared with nearby counties, whereas the relative proportion of abortions to women under age 20 years declined insignificantly, with a relative increase in the proportion of pregnancies (births and abortions) to young women in the county. Conclusions. Imposing a parental consent requirement for contraceptives, but not abortions, appears to raise the frequency of pregnancies and births among young women.

Abstract: Objectives. We assessed the impact of graphic Canadian cigarette warning labels. Methods. We used a longitudinal telephone survey of 616 adult smokers. Results. Approximately one fifth of participants reported smoking less as a result of the labels; only 1% reported smoking more. Although participants reported negative emotional responses to the warnings including fear (44%) and disgust (58%), smokers who reported greater negative emotion were more likely to have quit, attempted to quit, or reduced their smoking 3 months later. Participants who attempted to avoid the warnings (30%) were no less likely to think about the warnings or engage in cessation behavior at follow-up. Conclusions. Policymakers should not be reluctant to introduce vivid or graphic warnings for fear of adverse outcomes.

Abstract: Objectives. We assessed weapon use in intimate partner violence and perspectives on hypothetical firearm policies. Methods. We conducted structured in-person interviews with 417 women in 67 battered women's shelters. Results. Words, hands/fists, and feet were the most common weapons used against and by battered women. About one third of the battered women had a firearm in the home. In two thirds of these households, the intimate partner used the gun(s) against the woman, usually threatening to shoot/kill her (71.4%) or to shoot at her (5.1%). Most battered women thought spousal notification/ consultation regarding gun purchase would be useful and that a personalized firearm ("smart gun") in the home would make things worse. Conclusions. A wide range of objects are used as weapons against intimate partners. Firearms, especially handguns, are more common in the homes of battered women than in households in the general population.

We applied multivariate regression to a sample of 2136 unmarried, low-income, urban mothers from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. WIC participation was associated with small increases in the probabilities of initiating breastfeeding and having had at least 4 well-child visits since birth-behaviors that benefit infants beyond the newborn period-but not with breastfeeding duration.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated trends in prenatal care use and its association with low birthweight in a developing country. Methods. We examined data from 2 southeast Brazilian cohort surveys, 1 conducted in 1978-1979 and the other in 1994. Results. Socioeconomic inequalities in prenatal care use increased during the 15-year period of 1979-1994. Although prenatal care use increases paralleled increases in low birthweight rate during this period, having no prenatal care was associated with higher risk of low birthweight in both surveys. Inadequate prenatal care use was also associated with higher risk of low birthweight in 1978-1979 only. Conclusions. Increasing low birthweight rates among women who adequately used prenatal care may be causing a bias by reducing the estimates of the effect of inadequate prenatal care use on low birthweight rates.

The hospital determined that it needed to give the same in-hospital clinical and counseling support to young males as it gives to young females.

People valued contraceptives at 5 times the actuarial cost; in general, women and reproductive-aged persons were willing to pay more, but low-income men highly valued contraceptives. Most respondents (85%) said that contraceptives should be covered by health insurance plans. The full benefit of contraceptives exceeds their cost.

As employers, states can implement this policy for more than 5 million individuals nationwide. This study identified the extent to which states require smoking cessation treatment insurance coverage for their employees; of 45 states, 29 required coverage for at least 1 US Public Health Service (PHS)-recommended treatment, and only 17 of 45 provided coverage that was fully consistent with PHS recommendations.

An in-person survey of 1350 adolescents and parents assessed youth assets and risk behaviors. We analyzed data with X2 tests and logistic regression analyses. Results. When we controlled for appropriate variables, there were significant positive relationships between several youth assets and nonuse of alcohol and drugs. Furthermore, youths who possessed all of the statistically significant youth assets were 4.44 times more likely to report nonuse of alcohol and 5.41 times more likely to report nonuse of drugs compared with youths who possessed fewer youth assets. Conclusions. Our study supports the view that specific youth assets may protect youths from alcohol and drug use.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined racial/ethnic differences in significant depressive symptoms among middle-aged women before and after adjustment for socioeconomic, health-related, and psychosocial characteristics. Methods. Racial/ethnic differences in unadjusted and adjusted prevalence of significant depressive symptoms (score ≥ 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression [CES-D] Scale) were assessed with univariate and multiple logistic regressions. Results. Twenty-four percent of the sample had a CES-D score of 16 or higher. Unadjusted prevalence varied by race/ethnicity (P<.0001). After adjustment for covariates, racial/ethnic differences overall were no longer significant. Conclusions. Hispanic and African American women had the highest odds, and Chinese and Japanese women had the lowest odds, for a CES-D score of 16 or higher. This variation is in part because of health-related and psychosocial factors that are linked to socioeconomic status.

Abstract: Objectives. The California Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment Program was implemented in 1997 to provide family planning services for uninsured, low-income women and men. We estimated the impact on fertility of providing 500000 women with contraceptives. Methods. Paid claims and medical record review data were used to estimate pregnancies averted. Pregnancies women experienced while enrolled in the program and pregnancies they would have experienced given methods used before enrollment were modeled as a Markov process. Results. One year of Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment services averted an estimated 108000 unintended pregnancies that would have resulted in 50000 unintended births and 41000 induced abortions. Conclusions. Providing contraceptives to low income, medically indigent women significantly reduced the number of unintended pregnancies in California.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined gender similarities and differences in the predictors of substance use treatment entry and of the combination of treatment entry and completion. Methods. The sample consisted of 2219 male and female program participants. Maximum likelihood probit estimation was used to identify background and attitudinal characteristics predictive of substance use treatment entry and retention. Results. We observed gender similarities and differences in predictors of treatment entry and the combination of treatment entry and completion. Many of the factors that attract individuals to treatment are the same ones that keep individuals in treatment. Conclusions. Attitudinal predictors-namely, motivation to change-showed the greatest consistency between genders and between predictors of treatment entry and predictors of treatment entry and completion.

Abstract: Objectives. We assessed the association between childhood socioeconomic status (SES) and coronary heart disease among postmenopausal women. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 3444 women aged 60 to 79 years. Results. There was an independent linear association between childhood and adult SES and coronary heart disease. The association between childhood SES and coronary heart disease was attenuated when we adjusted for insulin resistance syndrome, adult smoking, physical activity, biomarkers of childhood nutrition, and passive smoking. Conclusions. The association between adverse childhood SES and coronary heart disease is in part mediated through insulin resistance, which may be influenced by poor childhood nutrition, and in part through the association between childhood SES and adult behavioral risk factors.

Abstract: Objectives. We compared complication rates after surgical abortions performed by physician assistants with rates after abortions performed by physicians. Methods. A 2-year prospective cohort study of women undergoing surgically induced abortion was conducted. Ninety-one percent of eligible women (1363) were enrolled. Results. Total complication rates were 22.0 per 1000 procedures (95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.9, 39.2) performed by physician assistants and 23.3 per 1000 procedures (95% CI = 14.5, 36.8) performed by physicians (P = .88). The most common complication that occurred during physician assistant-performed procedures was incomplete abortion; during physician-performed procedures the most common complication was infection not requiring hospitalization. A history of pelvic inflammatory disease was associated with an increased risk of total complications (odds ratio = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.1, 4.1). Conclusions. Surgical abortion services provided by experienced physician assistants were comparable in safety and efficacy to those provided by physicians.

Abstract: This study determined the accuracy of self-reports of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Men (N=402) attending 2 outpatient clinics were asked: "Did you have a PSA test today?" and their medical records were checked. Concordance, sensitivity, and false-negative values were 65%, 67%, and 33%, respectively, at 1 clinic site and 88%, 64%, and 36% at the other. The accuracy of self-reports of PSA testing should be interpreted with caution.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to describe the role and function of nursing facilities after disaster. Methods. We surveyed administrators at 144 widely dispersed nursing facilities after the Los Angeles Northridge earthquake. Results. Of the 113 (78%) nursing facilities that responded (11 365 beds), 23 sustained severe damage, 5 closed (625 beds), and 72 lost vital services. Of 87 nursing facilities implementing disaster plans, 56 cited problems that plans did not adequately address, including absent staff, communication problems, and insufficient water and generator fuel. Fifty-nine (52%) reported disaster-related admissions from hospitals, nursing facilities, and community residences. Nursing facilities received limited postdisaster assistance. Five months after the earthquake, only half of inadequate nursing facility disaster plans had been revised. Conclusions. Despite considerable disaster-related stresses, nursing facilities met important community needs. To optimize disaster response, community-wide disaster plans should incorporate nursing facilities.

Abstract: Objectives. We assessed associations between psychosocial factors and preterm birth, stratified by race in a prospective cohort study. Methods. We surveyed 1898 women who used university and public health prenatal clinics regarding various psychosocial factors. Results. African Americans were at higher risk of preterm birth if they used distancing from problems as a coping mechanism or reported racial discrimination. Whites were at higher risk if they had high counts of negative life events or were not living with a partner. The association of pregnancy-related anxiety with preterm birth weakened when medical comorbidities were taken into account. No association with preterm birth was found for depression, general social support, or church attendance. Conclusions. Some associations between psychosocial variables and preterm birth differed by race.

Abstract: Objectives. We analyzed the role of sociodemographic factors, chronic-disease risk factors, and health conditions in explaining gender differences in disability among senior citizens. Methods. We compared 1348 men and women (mean age = 79 years) on overall disability and compared their specific activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and mobility limitations. Analysis of covariance adjusted for possible explanatory factors. Results. Women were more likely to report limitations, use of assistance, and a greater degree of disability, particularly among IADL categories. However, these gender differences were largely explained by differences in disability-related health conditions. Conclusions. Greater prevalence of nonfatal disabling conditions, including fractures, osteoporosis, back problems, osteoarthritis and depression, contributes substantially to greater disability and diminished quality of life among aging women compared with men.

Title: The decline in maternal mortality in Sweden: The role of community midwifery
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Högberg, U.

Volume: 94
Issue: 8
Pages: 1312-1320
Abstract: The maternal mortality rate in Sweden in the early 20th early was one third that in the United States. This rate was recognized by American visitors as an achievement of Swedish maternity care, in which highly competent midwives attend home deliveries. The 19th century decline in maternal mortality was largely caused by improvements in obstetric care, but was also helped along by the national health strategy of giving midwives and doctors complementary roles in maternity care, as well as equal involvement in setting public health policy. The 20th decline in maternal mortality, seen in all Western countries, was made possible by the emergence of modern medicine. However, the contribution of the mobilization of human resources should not be underestimated, nor should key developments in public health policy.

Abstract: Students who possess and self-administer their asthma medications can prevent or reduce the severity of asthma episodes. In many states, laws or policies allow students to possess and self-administer asthma medications at school. In the absence of a state or local law or policy allowing public school students to possess inhalers and self-medicate to treat asthma, 3 federal statutes may require public schools to permit the carrying of such medications by students: the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Local policies and procedures can be based on these federal laws to ensure that students with asthma can take their medicines as needed.

Gender, insurance, mode of exposure, and geographic region were associated with access to medical care. Researchers and policymakers should consider sociodemographic factors among Hispanic patients who are HIV positive when designing and prioritizing interventions to improve access to care.

Pages: 1085-1089
Abstract: Six HIV candidate microbicides are scheduled to enter 6 large-scale effectiveness trials in the next year. The selection of products for testing and the design of this group of trials should be reconsidered to provide an answer to a key question now before the field: Does a sulfonated polyanion, delivered intravaginally as a gel, block HIV attachment to target cells with sufficient potency to protect women from sexually acquired HIV infection? Paradoxically, entering more candidates into more trials may confuse or compromise efforts to identify an effective product. Instead, a single trial of the most promising product(s) best serves the current candidates while also preserving resources needed to promptly advance innovative new protective concepts into future large-scale trials.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the effectiveness of community-level HIV prevention programming for men who have sex with men. Methods. We used multilevel methods to examine unprotected intercourse by bisexual men (n = 1016) with male and female partners in geographic regions with and without HIV prevention programming. Results. Men living in geographic regions with HIV prevention programming had significantly less frequent unprotected homosexual intercourse with both casual and regular partners. In contrast, no differences were observed for unprotected heterosexual intercourse. Conclusions. This study provides evidence supporting the effectiveness of community-level HIV prevention programming and the need for its broader implementation. The study also demonstrates the suitability of multilevel methods for examining the effectiveness of community-level public health programs.

Abstract: Preparedness for bioterrorism poses significant ethical challenges. Although public health ethics and preparedness have received attention recently, health care ethics must also be considered. In epidemics, the health care system assists public health in 3 tasks: detection, containment, and treatment. Detection might fail if all patients do not have access to care, or if physicians do not understand their obligation to report infectious diseases to public health authorities. Containment might fail if physicians view themselves only as advocates for individual patients, ignoring their social obligations as health professionals. Treatment might fail if physicians do not accept their professional duty to treat patients during epidemics. Each of these potential ethical barriers to preparedness must be addressed by physicians and society.

Abstract: We used an electronic medical records system retrospectively to evaluate how frequently, in a public hospital and its clinics, combined gonorrhea/chlamydia tests were accompanied by a syphilis test before and during a syphilis outbreak. Among 70330 gonorrhea/chlamydia tests (1996-2000), the proportion with a syphilis test increased from 13% (preoutbreak) to 50% (intervention period) for men and from 6% to 13% for nonpregnant women. The increased syphilis testing coincided with a multifaceted public health intervention.

Abstract: In late 2001, during the aftermath of the anthrax letter attacks, model legislation was proposed to relevant state agencies to update their states' public health laws to meet the threat of bioterrorism. This legislation was the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act. A concern underlying this and related efforts to address future bioterrorism threats was the perceived inadequacy of state laws to respond effectively when such threats occur. We evaluated how 4 states-Utah, Maine, South Dakota, and Indiana-addressed this concern in the context of the model legislation. The conclusion is that the model legislation generally served as an important catalyst for state action in the field of bioterrorism preparation.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of HIV-positive women who do not report highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use. Methods. We analyzed HAART use among 1165 HIV-positive participants in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Results. Between October 1, 2000, and March 31, 2001, 254 women with clinical indications for HAART reported not using it, 635 reported HAART use, and 276 had no clinical indications. In multivariate analysis, using crack/cocaine/heroin and a history of abuse decreased the likelihood of using HAART, whereas being White increased it. Conclusions. One of 4 women for whom HAART was indicated reported not using HAART. Childhood sexual abuse prevention, more intensive abuse treatment, and continuing drug treatment may enhance HIV disease treatment of women.

Abstract: Objectives. We compared level of psychosocial distress of HIV-infected women living in New York City before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with level of psychosocial distress reported by women living with the disease after the use of HAART became widespread. Methods. Data were from HIV-positive New York City women aged 18 to 50 years, enrolled through outreach and self-referral. We compared scores on measures of psychological state and psychosocial adjustment to illness of 74 women interviewed in 1994-1996 with scores of a matched group of 74 women interviewed in 2000-2002. Results. A significant difference between groups was found only with regard to adjustment to illness in their domestic environment, with poorer adjustment reported, on average, by women in the 2000-2002 sample. Conclusions. Although new treatments have significantly improved the physical health of those living with HIV/AIDS, no evidence was found that these treatments significantly improved psychological health for women, regardless of history of protease inhibitor use.

Abstract: Objectives. This study compares 3- and 6-month outcomes of a woman-focused HIV intervention for crack abusers, a revised National Institute on Drug Abuse standard intervention, and a control group. Methods. Out-of-drug-treatment African American women (n=620) who use crack participated in a randomized field experiment. Risk behavior, employment, and housing status were assessed with linear and logistic regression. Results. All groups significantly reduced crack use and high-risk sex at each follow-up, but only woman-focused intervention participants consistently improved employment and housing status. Compared with control subjects at 6 months, woman-focused intervention participants were least likely to engage in unprotected sex; revised standard intervention women reported greatest reductions in crack use. Conclusions. A woman-focused intervention can successfully reduce risk and facilitate employment and housing and may effectively reduce the frequency of unprotected sex in the longer term.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated physicians' delivery of HIV prevention counseling to newly diagnosed and established HIV-positive patients. Methods. A questionnaire was developed and mailed to 417 HIV physicians in 4 US cities. Results. Overall, rates of counseling on the part of physicians were low. Physicians reported counseling newly diagnosed patients more than established patients. Factors associated with increased counseling included having sufficient time with patients and familiarity with treatment guidelines. Physicians who perceived their patients to have mental health and substance abuse problems, who served more male patients, and who were infectious disease specialists were less likely to counsel patients. Conclusions. Intervention strategies with physicians should be developed to overcome barriers to providing counseling to HIV-positive patients.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined risk factors for HIV infection among Puerto Rican and Mexican American women aged 15 through 44 years. Methods. We used data from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth. Analyses focused on the relation between sex role attitudes, sex education, anxiety, and consistent condom use. Results. Nearly 60% of Puerto Rican and Mexican American women received no sex education from parents. Twenty-one percent of Puerto Rican and 38.3% of Mexican American women reported no sex education in schools. Women with some sex education in school, less than 13 years of education, or higher sex role attitude scores were more likely than other women to have partners who consistently used condoms. Conclusions. Harm reduction interventions must be designed to reach multiple Latino audiences by age, gender, and subgroup.

Abstract: Objectives. The authors examined HIV risk behaviors among African American, Asian/Pacific Islander (API), and Latina male-to-female (MTF) transgender persons in order to improve HIV prevention programs. Methods. Individual survey interviews with MTF transgender persons of color (n = 332; 112 African Americans, 110 Latinas, and 110 APIs) were conducted. Results. Prevalence and correlates of receptive anal sex and unprotected receptive anal sex (URAS) varied by type of partner (primary, casual, or commercial sex partners). URAS with primary partners was associated with drug use before sex; URAS with casual partners was associated with HIV-positive status and drug use before sex; and URAS with commercial sex partners was associated with African American ethnicity and low income. Conclusions. Findings on current risk behaviors among MTF transgender persons provided meaningful implications for HIV prevention interventions.

Abstract: Objectives. We conducted a case-control study of adulthood asthma and point-source respirable particulate air pollution with asthma-diagnosed case patients (n = 3717) and gastroenteritis-diagnosed control patients (n = 4129) to determine effects of particulate air pollution on public health. Methods. We used hospitalization data from Buffalo, NY, neighborhoods for a 5-year period (1996 through 2000), geographic information systems techniques, the Diggle method, and statistical analysis to compare the locations of case patients and control patients in terms of proximity to different known pollution sources in the study area. Results. We found a clustering of asthma cases in close proximity to the Peace Bridge Complex and the freeways and a dose-response relationship indicating a decreased risk of asthma prevalence the farther an individual resides from the source of exposure. Conclusions. These findings provide a basis for the development of new hypotheses relating to the spatial distribution of asthma prevalence and morbidity in this community.

Abstract: Objectives. We analyzed qualitative and quantitative data for 98 HIV-negative, low-risk women in Malawi, Zimbabwe, India, and Thailand who participated in a safety and acceptability study of BufferGel, a vaginal microbicide to determine the across-country acceptability of vaginal microbicides among women and their partners. Methods. Quantitative survey data were collected at 7 and 14 days after use among enrolled women, and exit interviews were conducted with women and their partners in separate focus group discussions. Results. Acceptability was high in all sites (73% of women approved of the microbicide). Women in Africa, where HIV infection rates are highest, were virtually unanimous in their desire for such a product, suggesting that an individual's perception of being at risk for HIV will outweigh concerns about side effects, problems applying a product, or other factors, when products are shown to be efficacious. But men and women reported that use, which was kept secret from an intimate partner, would be difficult and might "break the trust" of a relationship. Conclusions. Acceptability research across diverse settings through all stages of microbicide research, development, and postlicensure dissemination can help maximize acceptability and use.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated how, under various conditions, the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breastfeeding compares with the risk of death from artificial feeding. Methods. We developed a spreadsheet simulation model to predict HIV-free survival during 7 age intervals from 0 to 24 months for 5 different infant feeding scenarios in resource-poor settings. Results. Compared with artificial feeding, breastfeeding during the first 6 months by HIV-positive mothers increases HIV-free survival by 32 per 1000 live births. After 6 months, as the age-specific mortality rate and risk of death caused by replacement feeding both decline, replacement feeding appears to be safer. Conclusions. Under conditions common in countries with high HIV prevalence, replacement feeding by HIV-infected mothers should not be generally encouraged until after the infant is approximately 6 months old.

Abstract: This study examined the prevalence and correlates of unprotected anal intercourse among 758 young African American men who have sex with men. A quarter of the sample reported unprotected anal intercourse in the past 3 months; nonsupportive peer norms and not carrying condoms predicted risky sexual behavior. Effective interventions are needed that promote the use of condoms by changing peer norms and encouraging carrying condoms.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the 6-month cumulative incidence of anti-gay harassment, discrimination, and violence among young gay/bisexual men and documented their associations with mental health. Methods. Gay/bisexual men from 3 cities in the southwestern United States completed self-administered questionnaires. Results. Thirty-seven percent of men reported experiencing anti-gay verbal harassment in the previous 6 months; 11.2% reported discrimination, and 4.8% reported physical violence. Men were more likely to report these experiences if they were younger, were more open in disclosing their sexual orientation to others, and were HIV positive. Reports of mistreatment were associated with lower self-esteem and increased suicidal ideation. Conclusions. Absent policies preventing anti-gay mistreatment, empowerment and community-building programs are needed for young gay/bisexual men to both create safe social settings and help them cope with the psychological effects of these events.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated prevalence and intraprison incidence of HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus infections among male prison inmates. Methods. We observed intake prevalence for 4269 sentenced inmates at the Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institute between 1998 and 2000 and incidence among 446 continuously incarcerated inmates (incarcerated for 12 months or more). Results. HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus prevalences were 1.8%, 20.2%, and 23.1%, respectively. Infections were significantly associated with injection drug use (odds ratio = 10.1, 7.9, and 32.4). Incidence per 100 person-years was 0 for HIV, 2.7 for HBV, and 0.4 for HCV. Conclusions. High infection prevalence among inmates represents a significant community health issue. General disease prevention efforts must include prevention within correctional facilities. The high observed intraprison incidence of HBV underscores the need to vaccinate prison populations.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to determine whether adolescents whose favorite movie stars smoke on-screen are at increased risk of tobacco use. Methods. During interviews, adolescent never smokers taking part in the California Tobacco Survey nominated their favorite stars. We reviewed popular films released during 1994 through 1996 to determine whether stars smoked on-screen in at least 2 films. Results. One third of never smokers nominated a star who smoked on-screen, which independently predicted later smoking risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02, 1.82). The effect was strong among girls (OR = 1.86; 95% CI = 1.26, 2.73). Among boys, there was no independent effect after control for receptivity to tobacco industry promotions. Conclusions. Public health efforts to reduce adolescent smoking must confront smoking in films as a tobacco marketing strategy.

Abstract: Objectives. We assessed the association between initiation of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) regimens and sexual risk behaviors among HIV-infected women. Methods. We analyzed data from 724 women who initiated HAART between January 1996 and January 2001 and who had pre-HAART viral loads at or above 400 copies per milliliter. Results. Sexually active women were less likely (odds ratio [OR]: = 0.79) to report 2 or more partners during a 6-month period after HAART initiation than before HAART initiation. However, the risk for unprotected sex was higher after HAART initiation than before HAART initiation among all sexually active women (both those who reported 2 or more partners [OR = 1.84] and those who reported 1 partner [OR = 1.22]). Conclusions. Sexual risk behaviors are associated with receipt of therapy but not with therapeutic response, indicating a risk for transmission among female HAART recipients.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the effects of same-sex orientation on suicide risks for Guam's Asian/Pacific Islander adolescents. Methods. We used a probability sample and logistic regression analysis to identify suicide risk factors. Results. Same-sex orientation was associated with a greater risk of suicide attempt, especially for boys. Adolescents who reported suffering physical abuse in the context of a romantic relationship, engaging in binge drinking, and experiencing feelings of hopelessness were at greater risk for suicidal ideation and attempts. Race/ethnicity was associated with suicide risk for both boys and girls, and patterns suggest that membership in the same racial/ethnic group decreased suicide risk for girls and increased risk of suicide for boys. Conclusions. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual Asian/Pacific Islander adolescents in Guam deserve intervention and counseling programs to reduce suicide risk.

Abstract: With more than 60 potential microbicides being assessed in preclinical or clinical trials, most attention has been centered on products intended for topical application, with much less research conducted on the applicators that will be used to deliver the microbicides. However, applicator design relates to safety, efficacy, and acceptability. As the foundation for a more systematic approach to evaluating and possibly improving designs for topical microbicide applicators, we conducted a literature review and a series of interviews with microbicide developers, trial investigators, and trial sponsors. Our findings indicate that issues concerning applicator safety, reuse, and cost warrant further investigation.

Abstract: Despite growing recognition of violence's health consequences and the World Health Organization's recent classification of police officers' excessive use of force as a form of violence, public health investigators have produced scant research characterizing police-perpetrated abuse. Using qualitative data from a study of a police drug crackdown in 2000 in 1 New York City police precinct, we explored 40 injection drug using and 25 non-drug using precinct residents' perceptions of and experiences with police-perpetrated abuse. Participants, particularly injection drug users and non-drug using men, reported police physical, psychological, and sexual violence and neglect; they often associated this abuse with crackdown-related tactics and perceived officer prejudice. We recommend that public health research address the prevalence, nature, and public health implications of police violence.

Abstract: Objectives. We report HIV seroprevalence and risk factors for urban indigent adults. Methods. A total of 2508 adults from shelters, meal programs, and low-cost hotels received interviews, blood tests, and tuberculosis screening. Results. Seroprevalence was 10.5% overall, 29.6% for men reporting sex with men (MSM), 7.7% for non-MSM injection drug users (IDUs), and 5.0% for residual non-MSM/non-IDUs. Risk factors were identified for MSM (sex trade among Whites, non-White race, recent receptive anal sex, syphilis), non-MSM IDUs (syphilis, lower education, prison, syringe sharing, transfusion), and residual subjects (≥5 recent sexual partners, female crack users who gave sex for drugs). Conclusions. HIV seroprevalence was 5 times greater for indigent adults than in San Francisco generally. Sexual behavior predicted HIV infection better than drug use, even among IDUs.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the extent to which adolescents in Norway have been exposed to tobacco marketing despite an existing ban, and whether exposure is related to their current smoking or expectations they will smoke in the future. Methods. Questionnaires were administered to nationally representative systematic samples of Norwegian youths aged 13 to 15 years in 1990 (n = 4282) and 1995 (n = 4065). Results. About half in each cohort reported exposure to marketing. Youths reporting exposure were significantly more likely to be current smokers and to expect to be smokers at 20 years of age, after control for important social influence predictors. Conclusions. Adolescents' current smoking and future smoking expectations are linked to marketing exposure even in limited settings, suggesting the need for comprehensive controls to eliminate the function of marketing in promoting adolescent smoking.

Methods. Graduating scholars of the Northeast Public Health Leadership Institute were surveyed to determine differences in skill level in 15 competency areas before and after training. Surveys were completed after program completion. Results. The training program improved the skill levels of participants in all 15 competency areas. A relation also was detected between the frequency of use of the competency and the improvement experienced. Conclusions. Public health leadership training programs are effective in improving the skills of public health workers.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined associations between depressive symptoms and AIDS-related mortality after controlling for antiretroviral therapy use, mental health treatment, medication adherence, substance abuse, clinical indicators, and demographic factors. Methods. One thousand seven hundred sixteen HIV-seropositive women completed semiannual visits from 1994 through 2001 to clinics at 6 sites. Multivariate Cox and logistic regression analyses estimated time to AIDS-related death and depressive symptom severity. Results. After we controlled for all other factors, AIDS-related deaths were more likely among women with chronic depressive symptoms, and symptoms were more severe among women in the terminal phase of their illness. Mental health service use was associated with reduced mortality. Conclusions. Treatment for depression is a critically important component of comprehensive care for HIV-seropositive women, especially those with end-stage disease.

Abstract: Objective. We examined the location of commercial plasma donation centers in the United States over the period 1980 to 1995 relative to the geographic distribution of risk behaviors associated with transfusion-transmissible infections. Methods. The census tract locations of commercial source plasma clinics were described by measures of neighborhood social disadvantage and the prevalence of illicit drug use and active local drug economies. Results. Depending on the measure of social environment used, commercial plasma clinics were 5 to 8 times more likely to be located in census tracts designated high-risk than would be expected by chance. Conclusions. Commercial source plasma clinics were overrepresented in neighborhoods with very active local drug economies. These patterns persisted after the links between human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infections and plasma products had been established and may present risks to blood system safety.

A geographically targeted sexually transmitted disease education and screening intervention performed in collaboration with a local faith-based organization was able to screen hundreds of at-risk youths. The screened individuals included friends and sex partners from an extensive social-sexual network that transcended the boundaries of the target population. The intervention also provided an excellent opportunity to practice "street medicine," in which all screening and treatment was effectively conducted in the field.

Abstract: Objectives. We assessed the distribution of immunization records among 3 health care delivery sectors and the impact of a regional immunization registry on "up to date" rates. Methods. Immunization registry records in 2 regions were categorized as having originated in private practices, community health centers, or public health clinics. "Up to date" rates were calculated after we sequentially added immunization records from the 3 sectors. Results. The percentage of children with immunizations documented in multiple sectors increased with age from 7 to 24 months, and children who were seen in multiple sectors were more likely to be up to date. There were relative increases in "up to date" rates of 50% for children aged 24 months. Conclusions. The regional immunization registry is a powerful public health tool for increasing documented "up to date" rates and providing insights into patterns of immunization delivery.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined current racial/ethnic differences in immunization coverage rates among US preschool children. Methods. Using National Immunization Survey data from 1996 through 2001, we compared vaccination coverage rates between non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian preschool children. Results. During the 6-year study period, the immunization coverage gap between White and Black children widened by an average of 1.1% each year, and the gap between White and Hispanic children widened by an average of 0.5% each year. The gap between White and Asian children narrowed by an average of 0.8% each year. Conclusions. Racial/ethnic disparities in preschool immunization coverage rates have increased significantly among some groups; critical improvements in identifying, understanding, and addressing race/ethnicity-specific health care differences are needed to achieve the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating disparities.

Volume: 94
Issue: 6
Pages: 943-947
Abstract: Without an accurate assessment of the prospect of bioterrorist attack, it is especially challenging to evaluate the protocols for testing smallpox vaccines in the pediatric population. Usual regulatory mechanisms cannot shepherd research protocols with benefits that can only be characterized as "uncertain" in the face of more than minimal risk. When a protocol is placed in a government forum for analysis, the public has a unique opportunity to debate the balancing of research risks and benefits on behalf of children who are unable to assent to research themselves, as well as to express views about vaccination policy broadly. This model for review of pediatric research that may be without benefit will be especially important as challenging studies of various vaccines against a range of infectious properties, such as anthrax and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), emerge.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined trends in fruit and vegetable consumption in the United States. Methods. A 6-item food frequency questionnaire was used to assess consumption among 434 121 adults in 49 states and the District of Columbia who were sampled in random-digit-dialed telephone surveys administered in 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000. Results. Although the geometric mean frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption declined slightly, the proportion of respondents consuming fruits and vegetables 5 or more times per day did not change. With the exception of the group aged 18 to 24 years, which experienced a 3-percentage-point increase, little change was seen among sociodemographic subgroups. Conclusions. Frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption changed little from 1994 to 2000. If increases are to be achieved, additional efforts and new strategies will be needed.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed the effectiveness of a middle school vaccination requirement for raising second-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine coverage among adolescents. Methods. Random-digit-dialed telephone surveys were conducted before (1998) and after (1999) the implementation of a vaccination requirement for entry into the seventh grade in San Diego, Calif. Results. Vaccination coverage was higher among children subject to the vaccination requirement (seventh-grade students; 60%) than among fifth- and sixth-grade students 1 year before the requirement (13%, P<.001), and 8th- through 12th-grade students not subject to the requirement (27%, P<.0001). Conclusions. Middle school-entry vaccination requirements can rapidly and substantially raise vaccination coverage among students subject to the law.

Abstract: To avoid exploitaiton of host communities, many commentators argue that subjects must receive the best methods available worldwide. Others worry that this requirement may block important research intended to improve health care, especially in developing countries. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a framework for the conditions under which it is acceptable to provide subjects with less than the best methods. Specifically, institutional review boards should assume a default of requiring the "worldwide best" methods, meaning the best methods available anywhere in the world, in all cases. However, institutional review boards should be willing to grant exceptions to this default for research studies that satisfy the following 4 conditions: (1) scientific necessity, (2) relevance for the host community, (3) sufficient host community benefit, and (4) subject and host community nonmaleficence.

Abstract: Objectives. We describe results from year 1 of a surveillance system to monitor body mass index in children at the state level. Methods. A sample of 6630 children attending Texas public schools, weighted to represent 4th, 8th, and 11th grades within race/ethnic subpopulations, was assessed. Body mass index was calculated from measured height and weight; demographic information was obtained from a questionnaire. Results. Prevalence of overweight was 22.4%, 19.2%, and 15.5% for 4th-, 8th-, and 11th-grade students, respectively. Overweight prevalence was highest among Hispanic boys (29.5%-32.6%), fourth-grade Hispanic girls (26.7%), and fourth-and eighth-grade African American girls (30.8% and 23.1%, respectively). Eleventh-grade White/other girls had the lowest prevalence of overweight (5.5%). Conclusions. These data confirm the increasing prevalence of overweight among US children, especially among Hispanic and African American students compared to White/other students and fourth-grade students relative to 8th- and 11th-grade students.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the associations of having health insurance and having a usual source of medical care with age-appropriate childhood vaccination. Methods. Simulations were conducted with multivariate logistic regression models and a nationally representative sample of children to assess the likelihood of age-appropriate vaccination. Results. Simulated provision of health insurance and a usual source of medical care produced substantial increases in the likelihood of doses being received age-appropriately. Increases in the likelihood of a child's being up to date were also observed, but these increases typically were smaller than for age-appropriate vaccination. Conclusions. Changes in childhood vaccination status should be assessed in age-appropriate terms, because measures of "up to date" status may not capture the effects of immunization interventions.

Abstract: Objectives. We assessed the effect on trends in hepatitis A incidence of the 1996 recommendation for routine hepatitis A vaccination of American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) children. Methods. We examined trends in hepatitis A incidence among AIAN peoples during 1990-2001 and vaccination coverage levels among children on the largest American Indian reservation. Results. Hepatitis A rates among AIANs declined 20-fold during 1997-2001. Declines in hepatitis A incidence occurred among AIANs in reservation and metropolitan areas. Among 1956 children living on the Navajo Nation whose medical records were reviewed, 1508 (77.1%) had received at least one dose of hepatitis A vaccine, and 1020 (52.1%) had completed the vaccine series. Conclusions. Hepatitis A rates among AIAN peoples have declined dramatically coincident with implementation of routine hepatitis A vaccination of AIAN children.

Abstract: Intimate partner violence and child abuse are recognized both as public health concerns and as violations of human rights, but related government actions and inactions are rarely documented as human rights violations in the United States. Men who abuse female partners are also highly likely to abuse the children of these women. However, family courts are reported to often ignore risks posed by abusive men in awarding child custody and visitation. Battered women involved in child custody litigation in Massachusetts (n=39) were interviewed. A recurring pattern of potential human rights violations by the state was documented, corresponding to rights guaranteed in multiple internationally accepted human rights covenants and treaties. The human rights framework is a powerful tool for demonstrating the need for legal, social, and political reform regarding public health concerns.

Abstract: Because of the potential for conflicts of interest, Salmon et al. propose in this issue the creation of an independent vaccine safety board to assume responsibility for assessing the safety of licensed vaccines. We believe that the current system at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) facilitates needed interactions between those involved in risk assessment and risk management, provides substantial safeguards against conflicts of interest, and results in sound decisions. The CDC, given its role in promoting immunization, may be perceived to have a greater potential conflict and plans to review its vaccine safety activities. Both agencies recognize the importance of transparency in considering vaccine safety and welcome the opportunity to work with the public and the medical community to improve the quality of scientific information and decisionmaking.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated the short-term effect of a community-based effort to promote child rear seating in a low-income Hispanic community. Methods. Child seating patterns were observed pre- and postintervention at intersections in 1 intervention and 2 control cities. Brief interviews assessed exposure to program messages. Results. Child rear seating increased from 33% to 49% in the intervention city (P < .0001), which represented a greater increase than that in the control cities (P < .0001). The greatest improvement was observed in relatively higher-income areas. Rear seating was significantly correlated with reported program exposure. Incentives and exposure to the program across multiple channels seemed to have the greatest effect. Conclusions. Independent of legislation, community-based programs incorporating incentives can increase child rear seating.

Abstract: Public health officials contributed to the early 20th-century campaign against Mexicans and Filipinos in Los Angeles. In 1914, the newly established city and county health departments confronted the overwhelming task of building a public health infrastructure for a rapidly growing population spread over a large area. However, for several years public health reports focused almost exclusively on the various infectious diseases associated with Mexican Immigrants. Although the segregation of Mexicans was illegal in California until 1935, county officials established separate clinics for Whites and Mexicans during the 1920s. With assistance from state officials, local health authorities participated actively in efforts to restrict Mexican immigration throughout the 1920s and to expel both Mexicans and Filipinos during the 1930s.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined whether the positive association-between mortality rates and racial minority concentration documented in ecological studies would be found for health status after control for race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and region of residence. Methods. We estimated least squares and probit models using aggregate and individual health status data from the 1995, 1997, and 1999 versions of the Current Population Survey merged with data from the US Bureau of the Census regarding state- and county-level racial minority concentration. Results. Except in the case of older Whites, racial minority concentration was not associated with health status after control for individual characteristics and fixed regional factors. Conclusions. Racial minority concentration may not be a determinant of individual health; differential migration patterns may explain the anomalous result for older Whites.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated vaccine risk perception among reporters of autism to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Methods. We conducted structured interviews with 124 parents who reported autism and related disorders to VAERS from 1990 to 2001 and compared results with those of a published survey of parents in the general population. Results. Respondents perceived vaccine-preventable diseases as less serious than did other parents. Only 15% of respondents deemed immunization extremely important for children's health; two thirds had withheld vaccines from their children. Conclusions. Views of parents who believe vaccines injured their children differ significantly from those of the general population regarding the benefits of immunization. Understanding the factors that shape this perspective can improve communication among vaccine providers, policymakers, and parents/patients.

Abstract: Flint Photovoice represents the work of 41 youths and adults recruited to use a participatory-action research approach to photographically document community assets and concerns, critically discuss the resulting images, and communicate with policymakers. At the suggestion of grassroots community leaders, we included policymakers among those asked to take photographs. In accordance with previously established photovoice methodology, we also recruited at the project's outset another group of policymakers and community leaders to provide political will and support for implementing photovoice participants' policy and program recommendations. Flint Photovoice enabled youths to express their concerns about neighborhood violence to policymakers and was instrumental in acquiring funding for local violence prevention. We note salutary outcomes produced by the inclusion of policymakers among adults who took photographs.

A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to the 497 directors of US local health departments serving at least 100000 residents. Results. On average, two thirds of the 20 public health activities were performed in the local jurisdictions surveyed, and the perceived effectiveness rating averaged 35% of the maximum possible. In multivariate models, availability of public health activities varied significantly according to population size, socio-economic measures, local health department spending, and presence of local boards of health. Conclusions. Local public health capacity varies widely across the nation's most populous communities, highlighting the need for targeted improvement efforts.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the published literature on health programs in faith-based organizations to determine the effectiveness of these programs. Methods. We conducted a systematic literature review of articles describing faith-based health activities. Articles (n=386) were screened for eligibility (n=105), whether a faith-based health program was described (n=53), and whether program effects were reported (28). Results. Most programs focused on primary prevention (50.9%), general health maintenance (25.5%), cardiovascular health (20.7%), or cancer (18.9%). Significant effects reported included reductions in cholesterol and blood pressure levels, weight, and disease symptoms and increases in the use of mammography and breast self-examination. Conclusions. Faith-based programs can improve health outcomes. Means are needed for increasing the frequency with which such programs are evaluated and the results of these evaluations are disseminated.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated mortality differences according to socioeconomic status (SES) for employed persons in 27 states during 1984-1997. Methods. SES was determined for persons aged 35-64 years according to the "usual occupation" listed on their death certificates. We used US Census denominator data. Results. For all-cause mortality, rate ratios from lowest to highest SES quartile for men and women were 2.02, 1.69, 1.25, and 1. 00 and 1.29, 1.01, 1.07, and 1.00, respectively. Percentage of all deaths attributable to being in the lowest 3 SES quartiles was 27%. Inverse SES gradients were strong for most major causes of death except breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Heart disease mortality for highest and lowest SES quartiles dropped 45% and 25%, respectively, between 1984 and 1997. Conclusions. Mortality differences by SES were sustained through the 1990s and are increasing for men.

Abstract: Ethical issues that can arise in distinguishing public health research from practice are highlighted in 2 case studies-an investigation of a tuberculosis outbreak in a prison and an evaluation of a program for improving HIV prevention services. Regardless of whether such public health investigations represent research or practice, we see a need for ethics oversight procedures that reflect actual risks and enable timely responses to crises. Such oversight should accommodate the perspectives of persons and communities affected by public health threats and by governmental responses to those threats; it should further recognize that public health ethics is a distinct field combining bioethics, political philosophy, human rights, and law.

Pages: 918-922
Abstract: Increasingly, researchers grapple with meaningful efforts to involve communities in research, recognizing that communities are distinct from individuals. We also struggle to ensure that individual participants in research are fully protected. Community advisory boards (CABs) offer an opportunity to adopt a relationships paradigm that enables researchers to anticipate and address the context in which communities understand risks and benefits, and individuals give consent. CABs provide a mechanism for community consultation that contributes to protecting communities and fostering meaningful research. Furthermore, CABs can help us to re-create informed consent as a process. It is critical that we conduct research to understand the role of CABs in the informed consent process.

We correlated the decreased rates with the introduction and rapid uptake of PCV7. Lack of change in the hospital discharge rates for other age groups likely represents a slower uptake of PCV7 compared with that for children aged younger than 1 year.

We assessed the expectations of patients who use complementary therapy. Methods. Patients attending a British National Health Service (NHS) outpatient department that provided acupuncture, osteopathy, and homoeopathy were asked to complete a qualitative survey. Results. Patients expected symptom relief, information, a holistic approach, improved quality of life, self-help advice, and wide availability of such therapies on the NHS. Conclusions. Physicians' understanding of patients' expectations of complementary therapies will help patients make appropriate and realistic treatment choices.

Abstract: The National Immunization Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is responsible for controlling infectious diseases through vaccination, but the program also plays a key role in postlicensure vaccine safety assessment. The time has come to separate postlicensure vaccine safety assessment from vaccine risk management as recommended by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. The National Transportation Safety Board offers a useful model for developing an independent National Vaccine Safety Board that would have the authority to leverage resources and expertise of various government agencies, academia, and industry to oversee postlicensure vaccine safety investigations. Such a board would have been useful in recent vaccine safety concerns, and its independence from government programs would ensure optimal vaccine safety and enhance public confidence in vaccines.

The intervention delayed sexual initiation among boys, but not girls. Boys in the intervention condition also exhibited significantly greater knowledge than control students, perceived fewer peer norms supporting sexual intercourse, had more positive attitudes toward not having sex, had stronger sexual limits, and were less likely to be in situations that could lead to sexual behaviors. Psychosocial effects for girls were limited. Conclusions. The program was effective for boys, but not for girls.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the effect of demographic and socioeconomic factors on use of preventive services (prostate-specific antigen testing, colorectal cancer screening, and influenza vaccination) among elderly men enrolled in 2 Medicare+ Choice health plans. Methods. Data were derived from administrative files and a survey of 1915 male enrollees. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess the effects of enrollee characteristics on preventive service use. Results. Age, marital status, educational attainment, and household wealth were associated with receipt of one or more preventive services. However, the effects of these variables were substantially attenuated relative to earlier studies of Medicare. Conclusions. Some Medicare HMOs have been successful in attenuating racial and socioeconomic disparities in the use of preventive services by older men.

Abstract: Objectives. We assessed the prevalence and correlates of adolescents' reports regarding firearms in their homes, of their own, of close friends, and of same-aged peers. Methods. Random-digit-dialed interviews were conducted with 5801 adolescents as part of the California Health Interview Survey. Results. One fifth (19.6%) of California adolescents reported having a firearm in their homes; few (3.0%) reported having their own gun. Characteristics associated with having one's own gun and with perceptions regarding others' guns generally were consistent with characteristics associated with having a firearm in the home. The 2 exceptions were related to socioeconomic status and to ethnicity. Conclusions. The source from which adolescents obtain guns, especially adolescents from less wealthy households, merits further investigation. Further research is needed to ascertain the accuracy of Black and Latino adolescents' perceptions regarding handguns among their peers.

Title: What's New about the "New Public Health"?

Issue: 5
Pages: 705-709
Abstract: From its origins, when public health was integral to societies' social structures, through the sanitary movement and contagion eras, when it evolved as a separate discipline, to the "new public health" era, when health promotion projects like Healthy Cities appear to be steering the discipline back to society's social structure, public health seems to have come full circle. It is this observation that has led some to ask, "What's new about the 'new public health'?" This article addresses the question by highlighting what is new about the health promotion era-including adapted components of previous eras that have been incorporated into its core activities-and its suitability in addressing established and emerging public health threats.

Abstract: Objectives. The author examined the prevalence and predictors of colorectal cancer screening among the urban Japanese population of the United States. Methods. A sample of Japanese residents of major US metropolitan areas completed a self-administered mailed survey. Results. Physician recommendation, acculturation, and perceived psychological costs were consistent predictors of screening for colorectal cancer. Gender and marital status were related to screening via fecal occult blood testing; age, susceptibility, and health insurance were related to sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy screening. Conclusions. Colorectal cancer screening among the urban Japanese population could be increased with interventions seeking to promote physician recommendations for screening, alleviate perceived psychological costs among patients, and improve physician-patient communication.

Abstract: Swimmer's itch (cercarial dermatitis) affects people engaged in open-water activities. We report incidence and risk factors for a US lake. Water exposures and swimmer's itch experience were reported daily for riparian household residents and guests at Douglas Lake, Michigan, in July 2000. Incidence of swimmer's itch was 6.8 episodes per 100 water exposure days. Positive risks were (1) exposures in shallow water and in areas with onshore winds and (2) more days of lake use in July. Further epidemiological studies will help public health agencies address this bothersome problem at recreational lakes.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated how improved mental health services affect justice involvement among juveniles treated in the public mental health system. Methods. Our analyses were based on administrative and interview data collected in 2 communities participating in the evaluation of a national initiative designed to improve mental health services for children and youths. Results. Results derived from Cox proportional hazard models suggested that better mental health services reduced the risks of initial and subsequent juvenile justice involvement by 31% and 28%, respectively. Effects were somewhat more pronounced for serious offenses. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that improved mental health services reduce the risk of juvenile justice involvement.

Abstract: A series of court cases litigated by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Education Fund between 1956 and 1967 laid the foundation for elimination of overt discrimination in hospitals and professional associations. The landmark case, Simkins v Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital (1963), challenged the use of public funds to expand segregated hospital care. The second case, Cypress v Newport News Hospital Association (1967), reaffirmed the federal government's application of Medicare certification guidelines to force hospitals to open up patient admissions, education programs, and staff privileges to all citizens and physicians. Pursuit of a legal strategy against racist policies was an essential element in a national campaign to eliminate discrimination in health care delivery in the United States.

Abstract: In most countries, rates of mortality and malnutrition among children continue to decline, but large inequalities between poor and better-off children exist, both between and within countries. These inequalities, which appear to be widening, call into question the strategies for child mortality reduction relied upon to date. We review (1) what is known about the causes of socioeconomic inequalities in child health and where programs aimed at reducing inequalities may be most effectively focused and (2) what is known about the success of actual programs in narrowing these inequalities. We end with lessons learned: the need for better evidence, but most of all for a new approach to improving the health of all children that is evidence based, broad, and multifaceted.

Edentulous and poorer older adults are less likely to have coverage and less likely to report a dental visit than dentate or wealthier older adults. Conclusions. These analyses help to describe the needs of older adults as they cope with diminishing resources as a consequence of retirement, including persons previously accustomed to accessing oral health services with dental insurance.

Abstract: Objectives. We explored the association between diabetes mellitus and oral disease in a low-socioeconomic-status urban population. Methods. Dental records of 150 adults with diabetes and 150 nondiabetic controls from the dental clinic at Columbia University in Northern Manhattan matched by age and gender were studied. Results. There was a 50% increase in alveolar bone loss in diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic controls. Diabetes, increasing age, male gender, and use of tobacco products had a statistically significant effect on bone loss. Conclusions. Our findings provide evidence that diabetes is an added risk for oral disease in this low-income, underserved population of Northern Manhattan. Oral disease prevention and treatment programs may need to be part of the standards of continuing care for patients with diabetes.

The study was limited to non-Hispanic Blacks, Mexican Americans, and non-Hispanic Whites 50 years of age or older with a complete periodontal assessment during the dental examination. Results. Blacks with higher education and income levels had a significantly higher prevalence of periodontitis than their White and Mexican-American counterparts. The relationship between income level and periodontitis was modified by race/ethnicity. High-income Blacks exhibited a higher prevalence of periodontitis than did low-income Blacks and high-income Whites. Conclusions. Our findings call attention to the importance of recognizing socioeconomic status-related health differences across racial/ethnic groups within the social, political, and historical context.

We measured the change in delivery and cost of care provided to patients enrolled in a health maintenance organization before and after interpreter services were implemented. Results. Compared with English-speaking patients, patients who used the interpreter services received significantly more recommended preventive services, made more office visits, and had more prescriptions written and filled. The estimated cost of providing interpreter services was $279 per person per year. Conclusions. Providing interpreter services is a financially viable method for enhancing delivery of health care to patients with limited English proficiency.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated the health, activity, and social participation of people aged 70 years or older with vision impairment, hearing loss, or both. Methods. We examined the 1994 Second Supplement on Aging to determine the health and activities of these 3 groups compared with those without sensory loss. We calculated odds ratios and classified variables according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework. Results. Older people with only hearing loss reported disparities in health, activities, and social roles; those with only vision impairment reported greater disparities; and those with both reported the greatest disparities. Conclusions. A hierarchical pattern emerged as impairments predicted consistent disparities in activities and social participation. This population's patterns of health and activities have public health implications.

Abstract: Objectives. We estimated the prevalence and determinants of delayed and unmet needs for medical care among patients in a restructured public health system. Methods. We conducted a stratified cross-sectional probability sample of pri-mary care patients in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1819 adult patients in 6 languages. The response rate was 80%. The study sample was racially/ethnically diverse. Results. Thirty-three percent reported delaying needed medical care during the preceding 12 months; 25% reported an unmet need for care because of competing priorities; and 46% had either delayed or gone without care. Conclusions. Barriers to needed health care continue to exist among patients receiving care through a large safety net system. Competing priorities for basic necessities and lack of insurance contribute importantly to unmet health care needs.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to determine whether supplemental private insurance coverage among Medicare recipients alters patterns of health care or outcomes associated with acute myocardial infarction. Methods. Medicare patients hospitalized after a myocardial infarction were identified from New York City hospitalization records. Patients who had only Medicare coverage were compared with those who had supplemental private or public insurance coverage. Results. Patients with supplemental private insurance exhibited increased rates of revascularization and decreased rates of in-hospital mortality relative to patients with either Medicare only or Medicare and public insurance. Moreover, Blacks and women were less likely to undergo revascularization and exhibited higher in-hospital mortality rates. Conclusions. Despite Medicare, private insurance coverage appears to influence the likelihood of coronary revascularization among older patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction.

We reviewed silicosis case data from the construction industry in 3 states that have silicosis registries, and we conducted environmental monitoring for silica at highway repair work sites. Results. Our findings indicate that a large population of highway workers is at risk of developing silicosis from exposure to crystalline silica. Conclusions. Exposure control methods, medical screenings, protective health standards, and safety-related contract language are necessary for preventing future occupational disease problems among highway repair workers.

Abstract: Objectives. We tested the premise that punishment for cannabis use deters use and thereby benefits public health. Methods. We compared representative samples of experienced cannabis users in similar cities with opposing cannabis policies-Amsterdam, the Netherlands (decriminalization), and San Francisco, Calif (criminalization). We compared age at onset, regular and maximum use, frequency and quantity of use over time, intensity and duration of intoxication, career use patterns, and other drug use. Results. With the exception of higher drug use in San Francisco, we found strong similarities across both cities. We found no evidence to support claims that criminalization reduces use or that decriminalization increases use. Conclusions. Drug policies may have less impact on cannabis use than is currently thought.

Methods. A modified version of the US Food Security Survey Module was implemented by telephone survey with Maryland food stamp recipients. Results. Of the 245 households, 66% experienced food insecurity. Food security status was associated with participation in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, the summer food program, and a food bank. Food security status was not associated with the number of months households received food stamps. There was no difference between the food security status of households living in urban and rural counties. Conclusions. A gap exists between the food stamp support provided and some households' nutritional and economic needs.

Methods. We used linked Medicaid claims and enrollment files, WIC files, and the area resource file to compare dental services use for children enrolled in WIC with those not enrolled. We used multivariate models that controlled for child clustering and employed 2-step methodology to control for selection bias. Results. Children who participated in WIC had an increased probability of having a dental visit, were more likely to use preventive and restorative services, and were less likely to use emergency services. Conclusions. Children's WIC participation improved access to dental care services that should lead to improved oral health.

Abstract: Objectives. This study evaluated the effect of comorbidity at diagnosis on racial differences in survival among men with prostate cancer. Methods. Clinical and demographic data were abstracted from records of 864 patients diagnosed at 4 Chicago area hospitals between 1986 and 1990. Comorbidity was scored on the basis of clinical information in the Charlson index. Cause-specific relative mortality adjusted for age, stage, differentiation, and treatment was compared across Charlson scores with Cox proportional hazards functions. Results. Blacks had significantly greater mortality from prostate cancer and other causes (vs Whites, relative risk [95% confidence interval] = 1.84 [1.22, 2.79] and 1.69 [1.33, 2.29], respectively; P<.001). However, differences disappeared as initial comorbidity increased (1.75 [1.33, 2.31] vs 0.90 [0.59, 1.29] for scores = 0 and ≥5, respectively). Conclusions. Absence of a significant preexisting medical diagnosis is associated with a higher risk for excess mortality among Black men diagnosed with prostate cancer.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the association between discrimination and mental health service use among a representative sample of Chinese Americans. Methods. Our data were derived from the 2-wave Chinese American Psychiatric Epidemiological Survey, a strata-cluster survey conducted in 1993 and 1994 in a western American city. Results. Language-based discrimination was associated with higher levels of use of informal services and seeking help from friends and relatives for emotional problems. Negative attitudes toward professional mental health services were associated with greater use of informal services. Conclusions. The findings suggest that language-based discrimination influences patterns of mental health service use among Chinese Americans. Implications for service providers and policymakers are discussed.

Abstract: Objectives. We identified substance use patterns and factors associated with increased substance use after users become homeless. Methods. We carried out a 2-city, community-based survey that used population-proportionate sampling of 91 sites with random selection at each site. Results. Five hundred thirty-one adults were interviewed; 78.3% of them met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition criteria for substance abuse or dependence. Most of those who met the criteria reported using drugs and alcohol less since they became homeless, commonly because they were in recovery. Factors independently associated with increased use were no health insurance (odds ratio [OR]= 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02, 2.58), alcohol abuse or dependence (OR =3.5; 95% CI = 1.85, 6.78), and selling plasma (OR= 2.6;95% CI = 1.32, 5.14) or panhandling (OR= 3.0;95% CI=1.65, 5.55) to acquire drugs. Conclusions. Becoming homeless plays a role in self-reported substance use. Multiservice treatment programs and tailored interventions for homeless persons are needed.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the relationships between risk factors amenable to intervention and the likelihood of dental care use during pregnancy. Methods. We used data from the Washington State Department of Health's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Results. Of the women surveyed, 58% reported no dental care during their pregnancy. Among women with no dental problems, those not receiving dental care were at markedly increased risk of having received no counseling on oral health care, being overweight, and using tobacco. Among women who received dental care, those with dental problems were more likely to have lower incomes and Medicaid coverage than those without dental problems. Conclusions. There is a need for enhanced education and training of maternity care providers concerning oral health in pregnancy.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to determine prevalence rates of vitamin C deficiency and depletion in the United States. Methods. We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to assess intake of dietary, supplemental, and serum vitamin C. Results. Mean intakes and serum levels of vitamin C were normal; however, vitamin C deficiency and depletion were common (occurring among 5%-17% and 13%-23% of respondents, respectively). Smokers, those who did not use supplements, and non-Hispanic Black males had elevated risks of vitamin C deficiency, while Mexican Americans had lower risks. Conclusions. Health professionals should recommend consumption of vegetables and fruits rich in vitamin C and should recommend supplementation for individuals at risk of vitamin C deficiency.

Abstract: On July 1 2000, the State of Florida exempted adult motorcyclist and moped riders from wearing helmets provided they have medical insurance of $10000. Monthly time series of motorcycle occupant deaths are examined from 1/1994 to 12/2001. The interrupted time series analysis estimates a 48.6% increase in motorcycle occupant deaths the year after the law change. The impact estimate reduces to 38.2% and 21.3% when trends in travel miles and motorcycle registrations are controlled. Our findings suggest that the law's age exemption should be revoked.

Abstract: We estimated the annual cost of bike and pedestrian trails in Lincoln, Neb, using construction and maintenance costs provided by the Department of Parks and Recreation of Nebraska. We obtained the number of users of 5 trails from a 1998 census report. The annual construction cost of each trail was calculated by using 3%, 5%, and 10% discount rates for a period of useful life of 10, 30, and 50 years. The average cost per mile and per user was calculated. Trail length averaged 3.6 miles (range= 1.6-4.6 miles). Annual cost in 2002 dollars ranged from $25762 to $248479 (mean=$124927; median= $171064). The cost per mile ranged from $5735 to $54017 (mean=$35355; median=$37994). The annual cost per user was $235 (range= $83-$592), whereas per capita annual medical cost of inactivity was $622. Construction of trails fits a wide range of budgets and may be a viable health amenity for most communities. To increase trail cost-effectiveness, efforts to decrease cost and increase the number of users should be considered.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the association between exposure to violence and asthma among urban children. Methods. We obtained reports from caretakers (n = 851) of violence, negative life events, unwanted memories (rumination), caretaker-perceived stress, and caretaker behaviors (keeping children indoors, smoking, and medication adherence). Outcomes included caretaker-reported wheezing, sleep disruption, interference with play because of asthma, and effects on the caretaker (nights caretaker lost sleep because of child's asthma). Results. Increased exposure to violence predicted higher number of symptom days (P = .0008) and more nights that caretakers lost sleep (P = .02) in a graded fashion after control for socioeconomic status, housing deterioration, and negative life events. Control for stress and behaviors partially attenuated this gradient, although these variables had little effect on the association between the highest level of exposure to morbidity, which suggests there are other mechanisms. Conclusions. Mechanisms linking violence and asthma morbidity need to be further explored.

Abstract: Objectives. We compared types and frequencies of intimate partner violence experienced by women before and after receipt of a 2-year protection order. Methods. Participants were 150 urban English- and Spanish-speaking Black, Hispanic, and White women who qualified for a 2-year protection order against an intimate partner. Results. One woman committed suicide 6 weeks into the study. The remaining 149 women completed all interviews. Results showed significant reductions in threats of assault, physical assault, stalking, and worksite harassment over time among all women, regardless of receipt or nonreceipt of a protection order. Conclusions. Abused women who apply and qualify for a 2-year protection order, irrespective of whether or not they are granted the order, report significantly lower levels of violence during the subsequent 18 months.

Abstract: Objectives. We estimated adult binge drinking prevalence in US metropolitan areas. Methods. We analyzed 1997 and 1999 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data for 120 metropolitan areas in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Results. The prevalence of binge drinking varied substantially across metropolitan areas, from 4.1% in Chattanooga, Tenn, to 23.9% in San Antonio, Tex, (median = 14.5%). Seventeen of the 20 metropolitan areas with the highest estimates were located in the upper Midwest, Texas, and Nevada. In 13 of these areas, at least one third of persons aged 18 to 34 years were binge drinkers. There were significant intrastate differences for binge drinking among metropolitan areas in New York, Tennessee, and Utah. Conclusions. Metropolitan-area estimates can be used to guide local efforts to reduce binge drinking.

Abstract: Objectives. This cross-sectional, community-based, epidemiological study characterized Somali and Ethiopian (Oromo) refugees in Minnesota to determine torture prevalence and associated problems. Methods. A comprehensive questionnaire was developed, then administered by trained ethnic interviewers to a nonprobability sample of 1134. Measures assessed torture techniques; traumatic events; and social, physical, and psychological problems, including posttraumatic stress symptoms. Results. Torture prevalence ranged from 25% to 69% by ethnicity and gender, higher than usually reported. Unexpectedly, women were tortured as often as men. Torture survivors had more health problems, including posttraumatic stress. Conclusions. This study highlights the need to recognize torture in African refugees, especially women, identify indicators of posttraumatic stress in torture survivors, and provide additional resources to care for tortured refugees.

Abstract: Objectives. We assessed the 5-year, nationwide impact on road deaths of the raise in the speed limit (November 1, 1993) on 3 major interurban highways in Israel from 90 to 100 kph. Methods. We compared before-after trends in deaths as well as case fatality-an outcome independent of exposure (defined as vehicle-kilometers traveled). Results. After the raise, speeds rose by 4.5%-9.1%. Over 5 years, there was a sustained increase in deaths (15%) and case fatality rates (38%) on all interurban roads. Corresponding increases in deaths (13%) and case fatality (24%) on urban roads indicated "speed spillover." Conclusions. Immediate increases in case fatality predicted and tracked the sustained increase in deaths from increased speeds of impact. Newtonian fourth power models predicted the effects of "small" increases in speed on large rises in case fatality rates. Countermeasures and congestion reduced the impact on deaths and case-fatality rates by more than half.

At the peak of the SARS epidemic, significant reductions in ambulatory care (23.9%), inpatient care (35.2%), and dental care (16.7%) were observed. People's fears of SARS appear to have had strong impacts on access to care. Adverse health outcomes resulting from accessibility barriers posed by the fear of SARS should not be overlooked.

Abstract: Objectives. We studied housing characteristics, parental factors, and respiratory health conditions in Russian children. Methods. We studied a population of 5951 children from 9 Russian cities, whose parents answered a questionnaire on their children's respiratory health, home environment, and housing characteristics. The health outcomes were asthma conditions, current wheeze, dry cough, bronchitis, and respiratory allergy. Results. Respiratory allergy and dry cough increased in association with the home being adjacent to traffic. Consistent positive associations were observed between some health conditions and maternal smoking during pregnancy, many health conditions and lifetime exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), and nearly all health conditions and water damage and molds in the home. Conclusions. Vicinity to traffic, dampness, mold, and ETS are important determinants of children's respiratory health in Russia.

Abstract: Objectives. We explored a postulated association between daily driving time and knee pain. Methods. We used data from the Taxi Drivers' Health Study to estimate 1-year prevalence of knee pain as assessed by the Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire. Results. Among 1242 drivers, the prevalence of knee pain, stratified by duration of daily driving (≤6, >6 through 8, >8 through 10, and >10 hours), was 11%, 17%, 19%, and 22%, respectively. Compared with driving 6 or fewer hours per day, the odds ratio of knee pain prevalence for driving more than 6 hours per day was 2.52 (95% confidence interval=1.36, 4.65) after we adjusted for socioeconomic, work-related, and personal factors in the multiple logistic regression. Conclusions. The dose-related association between driving duration and knee pain raises concerns about work-related knee joint disorders among professional drivers.

Abstract: Popular magazines often rank cities in terms of various aspects of quality of life. Such ranking studies can motivate people to visit or relocate to a particular city or increase the frequency with which they engage in healthy behaviors. With careful consideration of study design and data limitations, these efforts also can assist policymakers in identifying local public health issues. We discuss considerations in interpreting ranking studies that use environmental measures of a city population's public health related to physical activity, nutrition, and obesity. Ranking studies such as those commonly publicized are constrained by statistical methodology issues and a lack of a scientific basis in regard to design.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed the economic burden of child abuse-related hospitalizations. Methods. We compared inpatient stays coded with a diagnosis of child abuse or neglect with stays of other hospitalized children using the 1999 National Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Costs and Utilization Project. Results. Children whose hospital stays were coded with a diagnosis of abuse or neglect were significantly more likely to have died during hospitalization (4. 0% vs 0.5%), have longer stays (8.2 vs 4.0 days), twice the number of diagnoses (6.3 vs 2.8), and double the total charges ($19266 vs $9513) than were other hospitalized children. Furthermore, the primary payer was typically Medicaid (66.5% vs 37.0%). Conclusion. Earlier identification of children at risk for child abuse and neglect might reduce the individual, medical, and societal costs.

Abstract: The racial politics of immigration have punctuated national discussions about immigration at different periods in US history, particularly when concerns about losing an American way of life or American population have coincided with concerns about infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the main theme running through American immigration policy is one of inclusion. The United States has historically been a nation reliant on immigrant labor and, accordingly, the most consequential public policies regarding immigration have responded to disease and its economic burdens by seeking to control the behavior of immigrants within our borders rather than excluding immigrants at our borders.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated the effect of family social and economic circumstances on intentional injury among adolescents. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional register study of youths aged 10 to 19 years who lived in Sweden between 1990 and 1994. We used socioeconomic status, number of parents in the household (1- or 2-parent home), receipt of welfare benefits, parental country of birth, and population density as exposures and compiled relative risks and population-attributable risks (PARs) for self-inflicted and interpersonal violence-related injury. Results. For both genders and for both injury types, receipt of welfare benefits showed the largest crude and net relative risks and the highest PARs. The socioeconomic status-related PAR for self-inflicted injury and the PAR related to number of parents in the household for interpersonal violence-related injury also were high. Conclusions. Intentional-injury prevention and victim treatment need to be tailored to household social circumstances.

Abstract: Objectives. This study investigated the effects of physical abuse in childhood on health problems in adulthood and assessed gender differences in these associations. Methods. We used data from 8000 men and 8000 women who were interviewed in the National Violence Against Women Survey. We used multivariate logistic regression to test for main and interactive effects and conducted post hoc probing of significant moderational effects. Results. Men were more likely than women to have experienced physical abuse during childhood. Whereas abuse had negative consequences for both boys and girls, it was generally more detrimental for girls. Conclusions. Findings suggest the need to consider gender differences and long-term adverse health consequences in the development of intervention strategies to address physical abuse in childhood.

Abstract: Using an administrative database, we determined rates of femur fracture by year of age for children younger than 6 years and by month of age. The highest rate of femur fracture was in children younger than 1 year and in 2-year-olds; the greatest number of fractures occurred during the third month of life. While femur fractures in children are often due to accidental injury, the reasons for the peak in the first year and the subsequent decline are not clear.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined prevalence, 3-year incidence, and predictors of physical and verbal abuse among postmenopausal women. Methods. We used a cohort of 91749 women aged 50 to 79 years from the Women's Health Initiative. Outcomes included self-reported physical abuse and verbal abuse. Results. At baseline, 11.1% reported abuse sometime during the prior year, with 2.1% reporting physical abuse only, 89.1% reporting verbal abuse only, and 8.8% reporting both physical and verbal abuse. Baseline prevalence was associated with service occupations, having lower incomes, and living alone. At 3-year follow-up, 5.0% of women reported new abuse, with 2.8% reporting physical abuse only, 92.6% reporting verbal abuse only, and 4.7% reporting both physical and verbal abuse. Conclusions. Postmenopausal women are exposed to abuse at similar rates to younger women; this abuse poses a serious threat to their health.

Abstract: Objectives. We conducted an ecologic analysis to determine whether housing characteristics mediate the associations between concentration of poverty and pediatric injury and between concentration of racial minorities and pediatric injury and whether the association between housing conditions and pediatric injury is independent of other risks. Methods. We created a hierarchical data set by linking individual-level data for pediatric injury with census data. Effect sizes were estimated with a Poisson model. Results. After adjustment for owner occupancy and the percentage of housing built before 1950, the association between concentration of poverty and pediatric injury was attenuated. For concentration of racial minorities, only percentage of owner occupancy had some mediating effect. In hierarchical models, housing characteristics remained independent and significant predictors of pediatric injury. Conclusions. The association between community characteristics and pediatric injury is partially mediated by housing conditions. Risk of pediatric injury associated with housing conditions is independent of other risks.

Abstract: We compared rates of reported health symptoms among surfers in urban North Orange County (NOC) and rural Santa Cruz County (SCC), California, during 2 winters (1998 and 1999) to determine whether symptoms were associated with exposure to urban runoff. NOC participants reported almost twice as many symptoms as SCC participants during the 1998 winter. In both study years, risk increased across symptom categories by an average of 10% for each 2.5 hours of weekly water exposure. Our findings suggest that discharging untreated urban runoff onto public beaches can pose health risks.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the longitudinal effects of a Housing First program for homeless, mentally ill individuals' on those individuals' consumer choice, housing stability, substance use, treatment utilization, and psychiatric symptoms. Methods. Two hundred twenty-five participants were randomly assigned to receive housing contingent on treatment and sobriety (control) or to receive immediate housing without treatment prerequisites (experimental). Interviews were conducted every 6 months for 24 months. Results. The experimental group obtained housing earlier, remained stably housed, and reported higher perceived choice. Utilization of substance abuse treatment was significantly higher for the control group, but no differences were found in substance use or psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions. Participants in the Housing First program were able to obtain and maintain independent housing without compromising psychiatric or substance abuse symptoms.

Abstract: The Sixteenth Street Community Health Center (SSCHC) in Milwaukee, Wis, is making a difference in the livability of surrounding neighborhoods and the overall health of the families it serves. SSCHC is going beyond traditional health care provider models and working to link the environment, the economy, and community health through urban brownfield redevelopment and sustainable land-use planning. In 1997, SSCHC recognized that restoration of local air and water quality and other environmental conditions, coupled with restoring family-supporting jobs in the neighborhood, could have a substantial impact on the overall health of families. Recent events indicate that SSCHC's pursuit of smart growth strategies has begun to pay off.

Abstract: Objectives. This study determined 4-year postintervention effects of Safe Dates on dating violence, booster effects, and moderators of the program effects. Methods. We gathered baseline data in 10 schools that were randomly allocated to a treatment condition. We collected follow-up data 1 month after the program and then yearly thereafter for 4 years. Between the 2- and 3-year follow-ups, a randomly selected half of treatment adolescents received a booster. Results. Compared with controls, adolescents receiving Safe Dates reported significantly less physical, serious physical, and sexual dating violence perpetration and victimization 4 years after the program. The booster did not improve the effectiveness of Safe Dates. Conclusions. Safe Dates shows promise for preventing dating violence but the booster should not be used.

Abstract: Although public health and urban planning emerged with the common goal of preventing urban outbreaks of infectious disease, there is little overlap between the fields today. The separation of the fields has contributed to uncoordinated efforts to address the health of urban populations and a general failure to recognize the links between, for example, the built environment and health disparities facing low-income populations and people of color. I review the historic connections and lack thereof between urban planning and public health, highlight some challenges facing efforts to recouple the fields, and suggest that insights from ecosocial theory and environmental justice offer a preliminary framework for reconnecting the fields around a social justice agenda.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated the protective effectiveness of speed humps in reducing child pedestrian injuries in residential neighborhoods. Methods. We conducted a matched case-control study over a 5-year period among children seen in a pediatric emergency department after being struck by an automobile. Results. A multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed that speed humps were associated with lower odds of children being injured within their neighborhood (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=0.47) and being struck in front of their home (adjusted OR=0.40). Ethnicity (but not socioeconomic status) was independently associated with child pedestrian injuries and was adjusted for in the regression model. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that speed humps make children's living environments safer.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to estimate the extended mental health service capacity requirements of persons affected by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Methods. We developed a formula to estimate the extended mental health service capacity requirements following disaster situations and assessed availability of the information required by the formula. Results. Sparse data exist on current services and supports used by people with mental health problems outside of the formal mental health specialty sector. There also are few systematically collected data on mental health sequelae of disasters. Conclusions. We recommend research-based surveys to understand service usage in non-mental health settings and suggest that federal guidelines be established to promote uniform data collection of a core set of items in studies carried out after disasters.

Five hundred ninety-four fourth- and fifth-grade students completed lunch food records 4 times during a 2-year period. Results. The fourth-grade cohort consumed fewer fruits, regular (not fried) vegetables, and less milk and consumed more sweetened beverages and high-fat vegetables during year 2. Conclusions. Middle school students who gained access to school snack bars consumed fewer healthy foods compared with the previous school year, when they were in elementary schools and only had access to lunch meals served at school. Healthy food choices and school policies that require healthier foods at school snack bars should be promoted.

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are essential for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions, where the causal chain between the agent and the outcome is relatively short and simple and where results may be safely extrapolated to other settings. However, causal chains in public health interventions are complex, making RCT results subject to effect modification in different populations. Both the internal and external validity of RCT findings can be greatly enhanced by observational studies using adequacy or plausibility designs. For evaluating large-scale interventions, studies with plausibility designs are often the only feasible option and may provide valid evidence of impact. There is an urgent need to develop evaluation standards and protocols for use in circumstances where RCTs are not appropriate.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to evaluate socioeconomic disparities in serum screening for Down syndrome and assess whether such disparities are more likely to reflect limits in access or information or, rather, informed decisionmaking. Methods. A nationally representative sample of 12869 French women completed Interviews after giving birth. Results. We found substantial disparities in the likelihood of (1) women not being offered screening, (2) screening not being offered as a result of late prenatal care, and (3) women not knowing whether or not they had undergone screening. Except in the case of nationality, there was essentially no evidence of differences in refusal of testing. Conclusions. Rather than representing informed decisionmaking, socioeconomic disparities in screening for Down syndrome are mostly due to limits in access or to information.

Abstract: Objectives. We estimated the prevalence of overweight in a population of young children enrolled in a New York City Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Methods. Administrative and survey data were collected from a sample of enrolled families. Body mass index (BMI) of 557 children aged 2, 3, and 4 years was compared by sociodemographic and nutrition characteristics. Results. Forty percent of the children were overweight or at risk for overweight (BMI≥85th percentile). Compared with other racial/ethnic groups combined, Hispanic children were more than twice as likely (odds ratio=2.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.8, 3.8) to be overweight or at risk for overweight. Two-year-olds were less likely to be overweight than 3- and 4-year-olds. Conclusions. Interventions to address childhood overweight should be culturally specific and target very young children.

We used telephone survey methods to measure suitableness of the perceived (vs objective) environment for recreational physical activity and nonmotorized transportation. Results. Most questions in our surveys that attempted to measure specific characteristics of the built environment showed moderate to high reliability. Questions about the social environment showed lower reliability than those that assessed the physical environment. Certain blocks of questions appeared to be selectively more reliable for urban or rural respondents. Conclusions. Despite differences in content and in response formats, all 3 surveys showed evidence of reliability, and most items are now ready for use in research and in public health surveillance.

Abstract: Developing an evidence base for making public health decisions will require using data from evaluation studies with randomized and nonrandomized designs. Assessing individual studies and using studies in quantitative research syntheses require transparent reporting of the study, with sufficient detail and clarity to readily see differences and similarities among studies in the same area. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement provides guidelines for transparent reporting of randomized clinical trials. We present the initial version of the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs (TREND) statement. These guidelines emphasize the reporting of theories used and descriptions of intervention and comparison conditions, research design, and methods of adjusting for possible biases in evaluation studies that use nonrandomized designs.

Abstract: It is now well known that standard statistical procedures become invalidated when applied to cluster randomized trials in which the unit of inference is the individual. A resulting consequence is that researchers conducting such trials are faced with a multitude of design choices, including selection of the primary unit of inference, the degree to which clusters should be matched or stratified by prognostic factors at baseline, and decisions related to cluster subsampling. Moreover, application of ethical principles developed for individually randomized trials may also require modification. We discuss several topics related to these issues, with emphasis on the choices that must be made in the planning stages of a trial and on some potential pitfalls to be avoided.

Abstract: Summary measures of population health, such as health-adjusted life expectancy, are increasingly being used to monitor the health status of regions and to evaluate public health interventions, Such measures are based on aggregated indicators of individual health and summarize health in a population. They describe population health status but have limitations in analytic studies of population health. We propose a broader framework for population health measurement. This classifies indicators according to their application (descriptive, prognostic, or explanatory), according to the conception of population (as an aggregate or a dynamic entity), and according to the underlying model of health. This approach extends the measurement repertoire to include indicators of the health of a population.

Eighty-seven percent of respondents with disabilities and 49% without disabilities reported at least 1 secondary condition. Adjusted odds ratios for disability for 14 of 16 conditions were positive and significant. The association of disability with substantial disparities in common conditions shows a need for increased access to general and targeted prevention interventions to improve health.

Abstract: The Multi-Country Evaluation of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) includes studies of the effectiveness, cost, and impact of the IMCI strategy in Bangladesh, Brazil, Peru, Tanzania, and Uganda. Seven questions were addressed when the evaluation was designed: who would be in charge, through what mechanisms IMCI could affect child health, whether the focus would be efficacy or effectiveness, what indicators would be measured, what types of inference would be made, how costs would be incorporated, and what elements would constitute the plan of analysis. We describe how these questions were answered, the challenges encountered in implementing the evaluation, and the 5 study designs. The methodological insights gained can improve future evaluations of public health programs.

Abstract: I reviewed sample estimation methods for research designs involving nonindependent data and a dichotomous response variable to examine the importance of proper sample size estimation and the need to align methods of sample size estimation with planned methods of statistical analysis. Examples and references to published literature are provided in this article. When the method of sample size estimation is not in concert with the method of planned analysis, poor estimates may result. The effects of multiple measures over time also need to be considered. Proper sample size estimation is often overlooked. Alignment of the sample size estimation method with the planned analysis method, especially in studies involving nonindependent data, will produce appropriate estimates.

Abstract: We evaluated perceived social and environmental supports for physical activity and walking using multivariable modeling. Perceptions were obtained on a sample of households in a southeastern county. Respondents were classified according to physical activity levels and walking behaviors. Respondents who had good street lighting; trusted their neighbors; and used private recreational facilities, parks, playgrounds, and sports fields were more likely to be regularly active. Perceiving neighbors as being active, having access to sidewalks, and using malls were associated with regular walking.

Abstract: Small physical activity increases may prevent weight gain in most populations. Geneva residents completed validated quantitative physical activity frequency questionnaires from 1997 to 2001. Fifteen minutes per day of moderate or brisk walking, or 30 minutes per day of slow walking, could increase physical activity at the population level; however, if the specific goal is to approach expending 420 kJ/d (100 kcal/d) through walking, the duration should be closer to 60 minutes for slow walking and 30 minutes for moderate or brisk walking.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the association of relative weight with individual income at different levels of socioeconomic status among gainfully employed Finnish women and men. Methods. We used a population-based survey including 2068 women and 2314 men with linked income data from a taxation register. Regression analysis was used to calculate mean income levels within educational and occupational groups. Results. Compared with their normal-weight counterparts, obese women with higher education or in upper white-collar positions had significantly lower income; a smaller income disadvantage was seen in overweight women with secondary education and in manual workers. Excess body weight was not associated with income disadvantages in men. Conclusions. Obesity is associated with a clear income disadvantage, particularly among women with higher socioeconomic status.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to determine precise estimates of infant mortality rates and to describe overall trends in infant mortality in Greenland and Denmark from 1973 to 1997. Methods. We analyzed data from population-based registries of all live-born infants in Greenland and Denmark to calculate infant mortality rates from 1973 to 1997. Results. Between the periods of 1973-1977 and 1993-1997, neonatal mortality rates in Greenland declined from 20.9 per 1000 live-born infants to 15.7, and post-neonatal mortality rates declined from 20.9 per 1000 to 5.9. Infant mortality rates were significantly higher in Greenland than in Denmark, and the excess mortality was uniformly distributed over all birthweight percentiles. In Greenland, the risk of infant death was significantly lower if the mother was born outside Greenland. Conclusions. Postneonatal mortality rates in Greenland have decreased significantly during the past 25 years, but little progress has been made in decreasing neonatal mortality rates. Disparities exist among children with different maternal origins.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the effectiveness of the Signs of Suicide (SOS) prevention program in reducing suicidal behavior. Methods. Twenty-one hundred students in 5 high schools in Columbus, Ga, and Hartford, Conn, were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Self-administered questionnaires were completed by students in both groups approximately 3 months after program implementation. Results. Significantly lower rates of suicide attempts and greater knowledge and more adaptive attitudes about depression and suicide were observed among students in the intervention group. The modest changes in knowledge and attitudes partially explained the beneficial effects of the program. Conclusions. SOS is the first school-based suicide prevention program to demonstrate significant reductions in self-reported suicide attempts.

Abstract: The classification of disease burdens is an important topic that receives little attention or debate. One common classification scheme, the broad cause grouping, is based on etiology and health transition theory and is mainly concerned with distinguishing communicable from noncommunicable diseases. This may be of limited utility to policymakers and planners. We propose a broad care needs framework to complement the broad cause grouping. This alternative scheme may be of equal or greater value to planners. We apply these schemes to disability-adjusted life year estimates for 2000 and to mortality data from Tanzania. The results suggest that a broad care needs approach could shift the priorities of health planners and policymakers and deserves further evaluation.

Abstract: Our study quantifies the impact of achieving specific Healthy People 2010 targets and of eliminating racial/ethnic health disparities on summary measures of health. We used life table methods to calculate gains in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy that would result from achievement of Healthy People 2010 objectives or of current mortality rates in the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) population. Attainment of Healthy People 2010 mortality targets would increase life expectancy by 2.8 years, and reduction of populationwide mortality rates to current API rates would add 4.1 years. Healthy life expectancy would increase by 5.8 years if Healthy People 2010 mortality and assumed morbidity targets were attained and by 8.1 years if API mortality and activity limitation rates were attained. Achievement of specific Healthy People 2010 targets would produce significant increases in longevity and health, and elimination of racial/ethnic health disparities could result in even larger gains.

Abstract: We reviewed group-randomized trials (GRTs) published in the American Journal of Public Health and Preventive Medicine from 1998 through 2002 and estimated the proportion of GRTs that employ appropriate methods for design and analysis. Of 60 articles, 9 (15.0%) reported evidence of using appropriate methods for sample size estimation. Of 59 articles in the analytic review, 27 (45.8%) reported at least 1 inappropriate analysis and 12 (20.3%) reported only inappropriate analyses. Nineteen (32.2%) reported analyses at an individual or subgroup level, ignoring group, or included group as a fixed effect. Hence increased vigilance is needed to ensure that appropriate methods for GRTs are employed and that results based on inappropriate methods are not published.

Abstract: We review recent developments in the design and analysis of group-randomized trials (GRTs). Regarding design, we summarize developments in estimates of intraclass correlation, power analysis, matched designs, designs involving one group per condition, and designs in which individuals are randomized to receive treatments in groups. Regarding analysis, we summarize developments in marginal and conditional models, the sandwich estimator, model-based estimators, binary data, survival analysis, randomization tests, survey methods, latent variable methods and nonlinear mixed models, time series methods, global tests for multiple endpoints, mediation effects, missing data, trial reporting, and software. We encourage investigators who conduct GRTs to become familiar with these developments and to collaborate with methodologists who can strengthen the design and analysis of their trials.

Abstract: From 1964 through the early 1980s, both federal and voluntary agencies endorsed the concept of "safer" cigarettes. Beginning in the mid-1980s, several factors, including revelations of tobacco industry malfeasance, the development of nicotine replacement therapy, and the reconceptualization of smoking as a chronic disease, led to "safer" cigarettes being discredited. In the past few years, some public health professionals have begun to reconsider the viability of developing such products. The issue before us is stark: will a commitment to limiting the toll exacted by smoking preclude the tolerance of a product that while not safe may possibly be safer?

Abstract: In August 2002, the Subcommittee on Cessation of the Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health (ICSH) was charged with developing recommendations to substantially increase rates of tobacco cessation in the United States. The subcommittee's report, A National Action Plan for Tobacco Cessation, outlines 10 recommendations for reducing premature morbidity and mortality by helping millions of Americans stop using tobacco. The plan includes both evidence-based, population-wide strategies designed to promote cessation (e.g., a national quitline network) and a Smokers' Health Fund to finance the programs (through a $2 per pack excise tax increase). The subcommittee report was presented to the ICSH (February 11, 2003). which unanimously endorsed sending it to Secretary Thompson for his consideration. In this article, we summarize the national action plan.

Abstract: Objectives. Our study presents national estimates of the proportion of youths in each of 7 stages of smoking and investigates the associations between risk/protective factors and progression to established smoking. Methods. We analyzed data from the 1999 and 2000 National Youth Tobacco Surveys. Results. In 1999 and 2000, 48.6% of US adolescents had at least experimented with tobacco, and 7.8% were established smokers. Important correlates of progression to established smoking included parental advice not to smoke, antismoking lessons in school, susceptibility to tobacco industry advertising and promotion, peer smoking and exposure to smoking at home. Conclusions. Interventions to stop adolescent progression to established smoking should target susceptible never smokers and early experimenters as well as those in later stages of smoking.

Abstract: The traditional view that excise taxes are regressive has been challenged. I document the history of the term regressive tax, show that traditional definitions have always found cigarette taxes to be regressive, and illustrate the implications of the greater price responsiveness observed among the poor. I explain the different definitions of tax burden: accounting. welfare-based willingness to pay, and welfare-based time inconsistent. Progressivity (equity across income groups) is sensitive to the way in which tax burden is assessed. Analysis of horizontal equity (fairness within a given income group) shows that cigarette taxes heavily burden poor smokers who do not quit, no matter how tax burden is assessed.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated whether socioeconomic circumstances at different life stages influence persistent smoking. Methods. We followed a British birth cohort (all births between March 3 and 9, 1958) for 41 years to examine the influence of childhood and adulthood socioeconomic position on persistent smoking in adulthood (n=6541). Results. Persistent smoking (19% of participants, n=1216) showed strong social gradients with both childhood and adulthood socioeconomic measures. Among men, the association with childhood socioeconomic circumstances was no longer significant after we adjusted for adulthood socioeconomic circumstances; however, among women, the adjusted odds of persistent smoking increased by 8% for each unit increase across a 16-point childhood score. Conclusions. Childhood socioeconomic circumstances predicted persistent smoking among women in our cohort, a finding that highlights the importance of influences on the development of persistent smoking across the life course.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to determine the effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and childhood cigarette smoking on asthma symptoms among middle school children in North Carolina. Methods. During 1999-2000, information was collected from a survey completed by the children. Outcomes of asthma symptom reporting were regressed on tobacco smoke exposures. Results. Children who currently smoked or reported any exposure to ETS were at increased risk of reporting active asthma symptoms. Exposure to ETS and childhood cigarette smoking was responsible for 15% of the asthma cases observed in the study population and $1.34 million in excess medical expenditures. Conclusions. Even at low levels of exposure, childhood cigarette smoking and ETS are independently associated with asthmatic symptoms.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined young adult smoking patterns and receptivity to cigarette advertising to assess vulnerability to tobacco marketing strategies. Methods. We obtained data from a telephone survey of 12072 Massachusetts adults. Results. Smokers aged 18 to 30 years were more likely than older adults to smoke only occasionally and to consume fewer than 10 cigarettes per day. They also were more receptive to cigarette marketing and were more likely to be frequent patrons of bars and clubs. Conclusions. Many young adult smokers are in the initiation phase of smoking and are likely to undergo a transition to either nonsmoking or heavier smoking. If unimpeded by regulation, tobacco promotion in bars and clubs is likely to lead to increased adult smoking prevalence.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to describe the burden of smoking on the US population, using diverse socioeconomic measures. Methods. We analyzed data from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey. Results. Overall, the prevalence of current smoking was greatest among persons in - and independently associated with-working class jobs, low educational level, and low income. Attempts to quit showed no socioeconomic gradient, while success in quitting was greatest among those with the most socioeconomic resources. These patterns held in most but not all race/ethnicity-gender groups. Finer resolution of smoking patterns was obtained using a relational UK occupational measure, compared to the skill-based measure commonly used in US studies. Conclusions. Reducing social disparities in smoking requires attention to the complexities of class along with race/ethnicity and gender.

Abstract: Certain groups in the United States remain at high risk and suffer disproportionately from tobacco-related illness and death despite progress made in reducing tobacco use. To address gaps in research on tobacco-related disparities and develop a comprehensive agenda aimed at reducing such disparities, representatives from funding agencies, community-based organizations, and academic institutions convened at the National Conference on Tobacco and Health Disparities in 2002. Conference participants reviewed the current research, identified existing gaps, and prioritized scientific recommendations. Panel discussions were organized to address research areas affecting underserved and understudied populations. We report major research recommendations made by the conference participants in several scientific domains. These recommendations will ultimately help guide the field in reducing and eliminating tobacco-related disparities in the United States.

Methods: Using a Chinese-language instrument based on validated questions from several national surveys, we conducted in-person, household-based interviews with 712 representative adults aged 18-74 years. Results: Observed smoking prevalence was 29% for men and 4% for women. Predictors of smoking cessation included being 35 years and older and having a high level of tobacco-related knowledge. Acculturation was positively associated with a history of never smoking, as was being younger than 35 years and having a high level of tobacco-related knowledge. Conclusions: Acculturation was positively associated with never smoking among men but not with smoking cessation. However, knowledge of tobacco-related health risks was associated with both. Results indicate a need for language-specific educational interventions.

Abstract: We compared reports of increased substance use in Manhattan 1 and 6 months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Data from 2 random-digit-dial surveys conducted i and 6 months after September 11 showed that 30.8% and 27.3% of respondents, respectively, reported increased use of cigarettes, alcohol, or marijuana. These sustained increases in substance use following the September 11 terrorist attacks suggest potential long-term health consequences as a result of disasters.

Abstract: Objectives. We used data gathered from 6259 youths between the ages of 13 and 23 years to compare trends in smoking among 4 racial/ethnic groups. Methods. We weighted trend data to represent baseline respondent characteristics and evaluated these data with linear contrasts derived from multiple regression analyses. Results. Although African Americans exhibited higher initiation rates than Whites, they exhibited consistently lower rates of regular smoking than both Whites and Hispanics. This seeming anomaly was explained by African Americans' lower rates of transition to regular smoking and greater tendency to quit. Racial/ethnic disparities were accounted for by differences in pro-smoking influences. Conclusions. Reducing racial/ethnic disparities in smoking may require reducing differences in the psychosocial factors that encourage smoking.

Abstract: High school smokers from 2 central Appalachian states received the American Lung Association's 10-session Not On Tobacco (N-O-T) program or a 15-minute brief self-help intervention. Our study compared the efficacy of N-O-T with that of the brief intervention by examining group differences in the 15-month-postbaseline (12-month-postprogram) smoking quit rates. N-O-T youths had higher overall quit rates. Review of end-of-program (3-month-postbaseline) and 3-month-postprogram (6-month-postbaseline) follow-up data showed state-level differences and positive cessation trends over time, regardless of treatment intensity. Quit rates were lower than rates found in other N-O-T studies of nonrural youths, suggesting that Appalachian youths are a recalcitrant smoking sample. Findings suggest that N-O-T is one option for long-term smoking cessation among rural teens.

Abstract: In the United States in 1997, the smoking prevalence among blue-collar workers was nearly double that among white-collar workers, underscoring the need for new approaches to reduce social disparities in tobacco use. These inequalities reflect larger structural forces that shape the social context of workers' lives. Drawing from a range of social and behavioral theories and lessons from social epidemiology, we articulate a social-contextual model for understanding ways in which socioeconomic position, particularly occupation, influences smoking patterns. We present applications of this model to worksite-based smoking cessation interventions among blue-collar workers and provide empirical support for this model. We also propose avenues for future research guided by this model.

Abstract: To evaluate a multicultural smoking prevention curriculum, 16 schools were randomized to receive the multicultural curriculum or a standard curriculum and program effects on 1-year smoking initiation among 1430 never smokers were assessed. Hispanic boys who received the multicultural curriculum were less likely to initiate smoking than were those who received the standard curriculum; effects were insignificant among other groups. The prevention effect among Hispanic boys is encouraging, but additional research is needed to improve prevention effects among other groups.

Abstract: We describe the tobacco industry's response to the American Stop Smoking Intervention Study (ASSIST). Tobacco industry documents from the University of California, San Francisco/Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and industry Web sites were analyzed. LexisNexis and the Library of Congress's Thomas Web site were searched for legislative history. We found that the tobacco industry considered ASSIST a major threat because of its emphasis on policy and creation of local tobacco control infrastructures. The industry mobilized resources for a well-coordinated attack on ASSIST. Although industry executives were sometimes frustrated in their efforts, they ultimately had a chilling effect on ASSIST. This evidence suggest that tobacco control advocates should expect a vigorous response from the tobacco industry to policy advocacy efforts, particularly at the local level.

Participation was highest for direct mail; participation in all 3 forms differed by gender, age, and race/ethnicity; current smokers, Whites, and persons aged 25 to 64 years reported greater participation. Although tobacco industry direct marketing may influence smoking initiation, its potential to increase consumption and impede cessation is unquestionable.

Abstract: Objectives. This study explored correlates with and changes in the prevalence of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure of children in the home. Methods. We used multiple logistic regression to explore ETS exposures as reported in the 1992 and 2000 National Health Interview Survey. Results. ETS exposure in homes with children declined from 35.6% to 25.1% (P<.001) between 1992 and 2000, whereas smoking prevalence declined 26.5% to 23.3%. Home ETS exposures were more prevalent among non-Hispanic Whites than among African Americans (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=0.702; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.614, 0.802), Asian Americans (AOR=0.534; 95% CI=0.378, 0.754), and Hispanics (AOR=0.388; 95% CI=0.294, 0.389). Exposures declined across all groups, with greater gains in higher education and income groups. Conclusions. Home ETS exposure declined sharply between 1992 and 2000, more than would be predicted by the decline in adult smoking prevalence.

Abstract: On June 20, 1997 a group of attorneys and health advocates proposed a "global settlement" of all public and private litigation against the tobacco industry. This agreement was controversial, and the subsequent implementing legislation was defeated. We sought to determine whether the global settlement represented a "missed opportunity" or a dead end. We compared the global settlement with subsequent laws, regulations, settlements, and judgments against the tobacco industry and found that other than Food and Drug Administration regulation of tobacco, tobacco control advocates have achieved many of the policies included in the global settlement and several beyond it. The policies that have been developed since 1997 have advanced tobacco control substantially, often beyond the provisions of the global settlement.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the effect of local restaurant smoking regulations on restaurant environmental tobacco smoke exposure among youths. Methods. We interviewed 3863 Massachusetts youths aged 12-17 years and ascertained how often they saw smokers in restaurants in their town. We assessed the effect of local restaurant smoking regulation strength on nonexposure to environmental tobacco smoke (seeing smokers never or only rarely). Results. Compared with youths from towns with weak regulations, youths from towns with medium-strength regulations had 1.4 times the odds (odds ratio=1.36; 95% confidence interval=1.12, 1.65) and youths from towns with strong regulations had twice the odds (odds ratio=2.03; 95% confidence interval=1.64, 2.52) of reporting nonexposure. Conclusions. Strong local restaurant smoking regulations are associated with reduced environmental tobacco smoke exposure among youths.

Abstract: Objectives. We identified and quantified differences in sociodemographic characteristics of communities relative to the strength of local restaurant smoking regulations in Massachusetts. Methods. We examined the relationship between the strength of the 351 local restaurant smoking regulations in Massachusetts and a number of town-level characteristics, using a multinomial logistic regression model. Results. Characteristics important to the adoption of stronger restaurant smoking regulations included higher education and per capita income, geographic region, voter support for a state cigarette tax initiative, board of health funding to promote clean indoor air policymaking, and the presence of a bordering town with a strong regulation. Conclusions. The current pattern of smoke-free restaurant policy enactment fosters socioeconomic and geographic disparities in health protection, undermining an important national health goal.

Abstract: We compared observed smoking prevalence data for 1995-2002 with predictions derived from a previously published population dynamics model to determine whether the recent trend in smoking prevalence is consistent with the downward pattern we predicted. The observed data fit our projections closely (R2=.89). Consistent with the logic underlying the model, we conclude that adult smoking prevalence will continue to fall for the foreseeable future, although at a rate approximately half that of the decline experienced during the 1970s and 1980s.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined Chicago residents' progress toward the Healthy People 2000 goal of reducing racial disparities in health and compared the results with a recent analysis of US data. Methods. Non-Hispanic Black-to-non-Hispanic White rate ratios were computed for 14 health status indicators for 1990 and for 1998. Results. Nationally and in Chicago, indicators for both Blacks and Whites improved between 1990 and 1998; however, Whites consistently fared better. Nationally, gaps narrowed on 10 indicators; for Chicago, they widened on 10 indicators. Conclusions. Nationally, there is apparent progress in reducing Black-White disparities; this is not true for Chicago. Whether failure to reduce racial disparities is unique to Chicago or is common to other urban centers remains an open question with important implications.

Abstract: Objectives. I tested the hypothesis that Black men with high levels of distrust (i.e., mild paranoia) are at greater risk of hospitalization for mental health problems than their White counterparts. Methods. Secondary analysis was conducted of data from a subsample of 180 men in an epidemiological study. Mental health hospitalization was the outcome and ethnicity/race, mild paranoia, and their interaction were main predictors in a logistic regression analysis. The ethnicity/race by mild paranoia interaction tested the study hypothesis. Results. The ethnicity/race by mild paranoia interaction was statistically significant. Contrary to the hypothesis, Black men with mild paranoia were less likely to be hospitalized. Conclusions. Black men's lack of trust regarding the mental health system may cause them not to seek services. Factors critical to increasing their trust are acknowledgment of racial biases in the mental health system and sincere efforts to eliminate racial disparities in mental health treatment.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated the relationship between friendships and suicidality among male and female adolescents. Methods. We analyzed friendship data on 13465 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health to explore the relationship between friendship and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. We controlled for known factors associated with suicidality. Results. Having had a friend who committed suicide increased the likelihood of suicidal ideation and attempts for both boys and girls. Socially isolated females were more likely to have suicidal thoughts, as were females whose friends were not friends with each other. Among adolescents thinking about suicide, suicide attempts appear largely stochastic, with few consistent risk factors between boys and girls. Conclusions. The friendship environment affects suicidality for both boys and girls. Female adolescents' suicidal thoughts are significantly increased by social isolation and friendship patterns in which friends were not friends with each other.

For each baby, an age- and sex-matched control was selected from the same center. Immunization status was tracked through age 24 months. Results. A higher proportion of intervention than of control babies were up to date at the end of a 9-month enrollment period (82% vs 65%, P < .001) and at age 24 months (66% vs 47%, P < .001). The younger the baby's age at enrollment in the program, the greater was the intervention effect. Conclusions. Tailored immunization calendars can help increase child immunization rates.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to identify individual and contextual predictors of adolescent smoking initiation and progression to daily smoking by race/ethnicity. Methods. We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to estimate the effects of individual (adolescent, family, peer) and contextual (school and state) factors on smoking onset among nonsmokers (n=5374) and progression to daily smoking among smokers (n=4474) with multilevel regression models. Results. Individual factors were more important predictors of smoking behaviors than were contextual factors. Predictors of smoking behaviors were mostly common across racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions. The few identified racial/ethnic differences in predictors of smoking behavior suggest that universal prevention and intervention efforts could reach most adolescents regardless of race/ethnicity. With 2 exceptions, important contextual factors remain to be identified.

Abstract: Family planning has long been acknowledged as an effective public health intervention. In recent years, however, family planning has come under increased scrutiny from conservative politicians and constituents. National US policies instituted since 2001 are resulting in cutbacks in family planning programs worldwide. In the long run, these conservative initiatives may set back several decades of progress in reproductive health and reproductive rights. In promoting an ideologically driven approach to sexual and reproductive health, the recent policy developments threaten to subvert ethical standards of medical care and the principle of evidence-based policy.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined gender differences in the effects of unemployment on mental health and assessed whether such effects are associated with interactions among gender, family roles, and social class. Methods. Our analysis included 3881 employed and 638 unemployed workers, aged 25 to 64 years, interviewed in the 1994 Catalonian Health Survey. Results. Unemployment had more of an effect on the mental health of men (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR]=2.98; 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.30, 3.87) than on that of women (age-adjusted OR=1.51; 95% CI=1.11, 2.06). Gender differences in effects were related to family responsibilities and social class. Conclusions. Understanding the effects of unemployment on mental health requires consideration of the interactions among gender, family responsibilities, and social class.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the relationships among maternal smoking in pregnancy, fetal development, and the risk of asthma in childhood. Methods. We conducted a population-based cohort study, where all 58841 singleton births were followed for 7 years using nationwide registries. Results. Maternal smoking increased the risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio=1.35; 95% confidence interval=1.13, 1.62 for high exposure). Low birthweight and preterm delivery increased the risk of asthma at the age of 7, whereas being small for gestational age did not. Conclusions. Maternal smoking in pregnancy increases the risk of asthma during the first 7 years of life, and only a small fraction of the effect seems to be mediated through fetal growth.

Abstract: Objectives. This study evaluated the quality of diabetes care for older American Indians and Alaska Natives. Methods. We analyzed the Indian Health Service Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit to determine whether completion of indicators of diabetes care differed as a function of age and whether additional patient and program factors were also associated with completion of the majority of the indicators. Results. Completion rates varied by age group, with significantly lower rates seen among the youngest and oldest. Patient diabetes education and duration of diabetes were most strongly associated with the completion of the majority of these indicators. Conclusions. Further studies are needed to determine effective interventions, including diabetes education, to improve the quality of diabetes care in the youngest and oldest age groups.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the relationship between continuity of care and diabetes control. Methods. We analyzed data on 1400 adults with diabetes who took part in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We examined the relationship of continuity of care with glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control. Results. Continuity of care was associated with both acceptable and optimal levels of glycemic control. Continuity was not associated with blood pressure or lipid control. There was no difference between having a usual site but no usual provider and having a usual provider in any of the investigated outcomes. Conclusions. Continuity of care is associated with better glycemic control among people with diabetes. Our results do not support a benefit of having a usual provider above having a usual site of care.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the prevalence of substance use among American adults aged 35 years, and we considered adulthood predictors and the impact of adolescent substance use. Methods. National panel data were drawn from the Monitoring the Future study. Logistic regressions were conducted to assess the impact of demographics, life experiences, and adolescent substance use on smoking, heavy drinking, prescription drug misuse, marijuana use, and cocaine use at 35 years of age. Results. Factors related to increased likelihood of substance use include high school use, unemployment, and noncustodial parenthood. Lower use was associated with being female, a college graduate, a professional, married, or a custodial parent. Conclusions. Among those aged 35 years, substance use was still rather prevalent and was a function of adulthood roles, experiences, and previous use.

Abstract: We describe a community-based pilot study to boost HIV testing in a minority community through social network recruitment and a noninvasive HIV testing methodology. Over an 11-month period, the number of test takers at the intervention site increased by 71.7%, and the proportions of test takers with risk factors similar to those of peer recruiters (heterosexual sex and multiple partners) increased by 24.2% and 19.5%, respectively. At a comparison site, testing remained stable, while the proportion of test takers reporting heterosexual sex and multiple partners decreased by 42.5% and 21.8%, respectively. The use of a social network recruitment strategy in combination with an oral HIV test shows promise in increasing testing and in targeting populations.

Abstract: Programs within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have recently taken steps to enhance social science contributions to health research. A June 2000 conference convened by the NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research highlighted the role of the social sciences in health research and developed an agenda for advancing such research. The conference and agenda underscored the importance of research on basic social scientific concepts and constructs, basic social science research on the etiology of health and illness, and the application of basic social science constructs in health services, treatment, and prevention research. Recent activities at NIH suggest a growing commitment to social science research and its integration into interdisciplinary multilevel studies of health.

Abstract: Although not a disease, suicide is a tragic endpoint of complex etiology and a leading cause of death worldwide. Just as preventing heart disease once meant that specialists treated myocardial infarctions in emergency care settings, in the past decade, suicide prevention has been viewed as the responsibility of mental health professionals within clinical settings. By contrast, over the past 50 years, population-based risk reduction approaches have been used with varying levels of effectiveness to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with heart disease. We examined whether the current urgency to develop effective interventions for suicide prevention can benefit from an understanding of the evolution of population-based strategies to prevent heart disease.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to identify factors associated with adult or child hunger. Methods. Low-income housed and homeless mothers were interviewed about socio-economic, psychosocial, health, and food sufficiency information. Multinomial logistic regression produced models predicting adult or child hunger. Results. Predictors of adult hunger included mothers' childhood sexual molestation and current parenting difficulties, or "hassles." Risk factors for child hunger included mothers' childhood sexual molestation, housing subsidies, brief local residence, having more or older children, and substandard housing. Conclusions. This study found that the odds of hunger, although affected by resource constraints in low-income female-headed families, were also worsened by mothers' poor physical and mental health. Eliminating hunger thus may require broader interventions than food programs.

Abstract: Objectives. We compared access and utilization of health services among American Indians/Alaska Natives (AIANs) with that among non-Hispanic Whites. Methods. We used data from the 1997 and 1999 National Survey of America's Families to estimate odds ratios for several measures of access and utilization and the effects of Indian Health Service (IHS) coverage. Results. AIANs had less insurance coverage and worse access and utilization than Whites. Over half of low-income uninsured AIANs did not have access to the IHS. However, among the low-income population, AIANs with only IHS access fared better than uninsured AIANs and as well as insured Whites for key measures but received less preventive care. Conclusions. The IHS partially offsets lack of insurance for some uninsured AIANs, but important needs were potentially unmet.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the prevalence of psychiatric illness among 3 homeless populations in St. Louis, Mo, in approximately 1980, 1990, and 2000. The 3 studies were conducted with the same systemic research methodology. Methods. We compared selected demographics and lifetime substance abuse and dependence and other mental illness among the 3 populations. Results. Among the homeless populations we studied, the prevalence of mood and substance use disorders dramatically increased, and the number of minorities within these populations has increased. Conclusions. The prevalence of psychiatric illness, including substance abuse and dependence, is not static in the homeless population. Service systems need to be aware of potential prevalence changes and the impact of these changes on service needs.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the lifetime and the past-year prevalence and correlates of common mental disorders among American Indian and Alaska Native women who presented for primary care. Methods. We screened 489 consecutively presenting female primary care patients aged 18 through 45 years with the General Health Questionnaire, 12-item version. A subsample (n = 234) completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. We examined associations between psychiatric disorders and sociodemographic variables, boarding school attendance, and psychopathology in the family of origin. Results. The study participants had high rates of alcohol use disorders, anxiety disorders, and anxiety/depression comorbidity compared with other samples of non-American Indian/Alaska Native women in primary care settings. Conclusions. There is a need for culturally appropriate mental health treatments and preventive services.

Abstract: Elevated blood pressure levels are a major cause of heart disease and stroke. Healthy People 2010 established objectives to reduce mortality from these diseases by 20% and to reduce the major causal factors associated with these elevated levels, such as excess sodium intake. The American public consumes far more sodium than is needed, most of which is added by food manufacturers and restaurants. In November 2002, the American Public Health Association adopted a policy resolution calling for a 50% reduction in sodium in the nation's food supply over the next 10 years. Such a reduction would greatly enhance the chances of attaining the Healthy People 2010 objectives and would save at least 150 000 lives annually. This issue warrants public health intervention.
